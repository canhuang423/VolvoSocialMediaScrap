No car can be all things.
If you want a Corvette, you understand that it can't have the gas mileage of a Prius. 

This is the T5 C30 with 17 in wheels:

A small, nimble car with an appealing and distinctive aesthetic that coddles the driver with excellent ride dynamics and great interior design.
 
It is not trying to be a track car.
It is 2+2 GT road car.
It gets you through your driving day with a minimum of fatigue and a maximum of bliss.
It has the quickness and agility to squeeze through traffic, yet still has a cabin that is quiet and comfortable.
Plus, it feels like quality, it is nice to look at, and it is just fun to drive. "

My 2011 C30 is refreshing and my passengers love the upgrade. It is the perfect car for me. I am in my early 30's married with no children, so I rarely have back seat passengers (a must for this car). This car so sophisticated with out being boring or stuffy. Fun, fast and fabulous, I don't understand why more people aren't in love... that's okay because I love having a car that makes a statement the individual. "

The styling is amazing, handling great, seats the most comfortable I've ever sat in (heated seats a huge bonus) and great fun to drive.
Other high points are bluetooth which works amazingly well, iPod integration, and great visibility.
Only drawbacks (and minor at best), huge, oversized key, so-so mileage and difficulty accessing rear seat.
All that said, I would recommend the C30 to everyone. "

I disagree. I used to have a 2008 Cooper S, and it spent months at the shop, had to sell it at a loss. Used to have a MazdaSpeed 3 - great car, but uncomfortable on city streets. The Volvo is a car made for the real world - I don't go to tracks every Saturday; this car ROCKS 95% of the time. It's not the last word on performance and handling, but it's the best mix of comfort and sporty driving I could find. And the exterior - it's just a work of art. I never thought I'd own a Volvo, but I'm happy I do now! "

I wanted something with a European feel when driving and this car nailed it.
The Car has more than ample horsepower.
Exterior Styling is a attention grabber.....Going to a new drive thru window always has the kids commenting on the car.
It really is a wonder why there is not many on the road, but it sure does get attention....Interior is a BIT BORING, but I spiced it up with amplifiers.
Kinda upset that door sills are not dressed up like other ""luxury"" brands.
If you want something with performance and not just a kiddie compact tuner cars this will get attention.
My first Volvo and I love it.
Hatch is small. "

It seems to have all the features of a Mazdaspeed, GTI, etc.
This car is more comfortable than any other car that I have previously owned (GTI, Mazdaspeed, Civic Si).

Nice that I can use 87 octane gas.
MPG so far is a little better than 27 mpg/gallon combined.
I believe it still needs to be broken in.


Also, overall cost is really no different than a loaded GTI.
By the way, I have leather, sunroof, and 100K Maintenance plan.
I do believe that the Mazdaspeed is a little faster, but I am commuting not street racing. "

It has a very nice balance between handling and comfort with a bent toward the fun side. The acceleration is decent and the car is nice and solid. For such a small car, I feel safe (I guess typical Volvo) -- the doors are sturdy and the car is heavy for its class. The car is unique in appearance and is general a joy to drive (have put 2,000 miles on the car - so beyond the ""honeymoon"" period. Demerits include slight rattle from both windows when partially down and horrible whistling wind noise from the seatbelt outlets when fully open. Decent but not great Dynaudio sound; manual not up to par with other European cars. "

Excellent daily driver with very good performance. Actual gas mileage has exceeded expectations at 24 mpg around town and 31 mpg on a long highway trip. The distinctive looks draw a bit of attention.
Rides much more comfortably and looks much better than the GTI in my view. Everything simply works well. I'm particularly happy with the cabin ergonomics.
Have not had any wind noise issues as others reported. A refined and reasonably priced car given the free maintenance, especially now that end of year rebates are available.  "

I've had the R-Design for about 6 months now and love driving it.
The handling is very tight and the acceleration is good for its class.
The body styling sets you apart from the crowd and the interior styling is comfortable and very functional.
The ability to customize features and options hits the mark.

The only drawback is that the exterior r-design styling features seem a bit flimsy - we'll see how they hold up over time.

I couldn't be happier with this car - at least until the polestar version is available. "

Brought it back to dealership twice wondering why oh why doesn't this car have a firm break pedal. Why must I travel halfway down before breaks engage and when they do why does it feel so choppy?  Is this a Volvo trademark because if it is I sure don't want or need it.  This one very important aspect has left me lukewarm on this car and wondering if I made a $25k mistake which I will now regret until I trade it in.

It handles even better than advertised, very tigthly built and EXTREMELY fun to drive. Due it's unique design and Volvo doing a poor job of advertising the C30, it's seldom seen on the road, which makes folks stop and look. It's not just another Japanese hatchback/econo box. Most important to us was it's best in class safety rating. We did our homework before we bought the C30 and it exceeded our expectations in all areas "

The C30 has major wind noise issues. This gas milage is aslo poor - 21 in combined city/highway driving.

After 3 months and 1300 miles, had to take the car into the dealer - hissing noise under hood. Leaking either coolant or refrigerant. Only good thing so far is it comes with 5 year 60-month bumper-to-bumper warranty and it looks COOL. If only my wife had chosen a another car or I had waited for the LEXUS CT-200! So buyer beware. "

The C30 is even more fun to drive than the S40 was. I was concerned about ride stiffness from the R-Design with the lower profile tires but while the ride is firmer it is not uncomfortable at all on the roads we drive daily. Our choice of styling was confirmed when a new VW GTI that still had the paper tags on it had the driver and two passengers admiring the C30 when we were running side by side on the expressway.

It has a nice heavy feel, but has quick response when driving.  The back hatch makes for convenient loading and with the seats down, it hold a ton of stuff.  We had no major problems, just the normal stuff.  We sold it because we wanted a car with better gas mileage that didn’t require premium gas.  Only drawback, but 8 years with a car is pretty good. "

I was looking for a driver's car and this is it.
The driving confort and position is superb.
The power is very good at low RPM, the 2.5 L. turbo has a lots of tork at only 1500 RPM. and no turbo lag.
If you are looking for a reliable European car, this is it, the ride is very confortable for our bad roads.
I selected the 16' wheels for that reason.
I just drove from Vermont to Nova Scotia in 12 hours non stop with zero back problems.
I dont understand why this car is not selling more as mine was the price of a Civic SI and Volvo is having huge promotions with 5years waranty and free maintenance 0% finance and $5000. off. "

Lightest Volvo sold in U.S. but still has sturdy 5 cyl engine.  They sold few of these models in U.S. because hatchbacks don't appeal here.  The styling is very attractive and retro.  You will rarely see another one on the road.  Car people notice this rare model and will compliment you about it.  Sweet exhaust note on start up.  2013 is last year sold in U.S. but still being sold in Europe.  Hurry, hurry buy one while you still can.  It is compact with limited rear space but the front space is good.  I am 6'2 and super comfy in front seat.  Built safe, heavy body for small car, look at the doors and body.  They were super expensive when new $35K and depreciated rapidly, typical Volvo.  However I think the limited supply means the values stabilize well starting at the 3 year mark.  10 year old examples sell for big prices.  A lot of used examples have 180K miles still running. "

We purchased the last '13 new in July'14.  Auto trans, T-5.  Did TONS of research beforehand.  We are a Toyota/Honda family, so European is a departure, with trepidation.  We have the Premier Plus package, not R-Design.   Thus far, the car is beyond expectations; a joy to drive, beautiful to look at, and well made.  It's QUIET inside, very powerful, and so different. You won't see them often, which is nice too.  It's not a high performance hatch, and that's good, because we didn't want that.  For those w/o kids, and a different hauling vehicle, this is a great commuter that spoils with luxury, is safe, and gives you confidence.  
2017 update; a couple of warranted replacement items with the car; though it continues to be great, and has cool accessories you can get from Volvo. We had some repairs from hitting a curb and major hail damage. After a few trials the rattles and squeaks were eliminated. But it took a few times. Hopefully once warranty expires we won't eat crow. Only complaint is the doors don't have good detents so they fall back into your legs pretty easily. That's it. Dealer support has been beyond expectations. It's sleeper fast. "

It has the 6-speed manual (deal breaker for me without). I drove all the way from Little Rock, AR to Durango, CO in one day.

(I live in a rural area, mostly hwy driving.) I have already put 20k miles on it without any problems, but I am only at 38k total. I have also been very impressed with any Volvo service experience I have had thus far. I have a friend that is absolutely in love with her GTI, but I find my C30 to handle much better and be much more comfortable, albeit a bit smaller.

I have looked for one for years the way I wanted it optioned. I got a great deal on my r-design with the six speed manual polestar upgrade. It had everything I wanted and no navigation :) I have had it for a year and it’s my first Volvo. I’m sold we bought an r-design XC90 6 months after this one. The build quality is great. Very solid and substantial is the best way to describe it.       I just rolled over 93k and no issues. I have a squeak in the back when it’s cold but that’s been it. The seats are comfy and the bi zenon head lights are the best I’ve ever had in any car hands down. I wish I had reverse parking sensors though. It really moves when you put your foot down. I find it an excellent compromise for warning speed, handling and comfort.  I do a lot of maintenance myself and it’s a little bit more for fluids and air filters but a few bucks is well worth it. I get the compliments others talk about on here. Sometimes even stopped at a light now and again. This is one car I will not get rid of. It’ll be here in the garage for as long as I can see. It’s truly functional and so unique. I’d buy it all over again any day of the week. It’s made a Volvo family out of us. "

This car is very well put together, looks great, handles well, and has plenty of power on tap when you need it.
It is very comfortable as a daily commuter, even with the stiffer R-Design suspension.
As other reviews across the web have stated, the steering is a bit numb and the manual shift action a bit rubbery compared to other sport coupes/""hot hatches"", but it makes up for it with how well the overall package fits together.
This is a car that somehow seems greater than the sum of it's parts.

It looks ""great"" they tell me....   bring it back in at 67K,  out of warranty....   repair bill 4K - I asked, all this happened in the last 7k miles?   yep they say, nothing covered, shocks, struts, motor mounts etc....   Oh - and by the way, the AC blows hot again! - 1400 to repair,  I threw a fit - wrote a letter to volvo, they sent me back a check for 1200....   since then, replaced another motor mount,  transmission mount, some oil sensor and housing that was leaking, cv boots and joints, front axles   all in all, 7400$ ALL SINCE THAT 60 K CHECKUP (I now have 90k miles on it)  replaced the headlamps twice, and now the driver side doesn't work at all - even after replacing the bulbs....    too bad, I love the look of the car, but no more volvos for me....   UPDATE  - since the last review at 90K I have dumped another 4K into the car - just not worth buying another volvo...   since 60K miles and total ownership cost well over 12K when you include regular maintenance....

Mustang reliability is much better.  And we are a long time Volvo family !     What a shock to get this one and it is the last one for us.     I bought this car for my children and grandchildren to be safe, but it is difficult to know whether it is safe because I cannot keep it running.... It seems that if the car is not driven daily, the battery runs down.  The dealer insists that nothing is wrong with the battery.    The tires wore out early , apparently because of an alignment problem that caused front and rear tires to wear on the inside.  Although the car was taken in for regular maintenance, this was not discovered until the tires were non-viable.    Little parts were regularly found lying in the car ( they matched the car interior) and appear to be covers for something, but the dealer has no idea what.  The piece in front of the passenger feet keeps falling down and must be repositioned.  It has been replaced by the dealer without improvement.     There Is a side hatch on  the driver's side that will not stay closed. It has been replaced without benefit.  There are more gnawing problems.  I just had to get a coil replaced. we were out of town for 2 weeks and my dayghter had to get people with much older vehicles to provide transportation because no one could keep the car cranked due to presumably the battery ( hard to know .  The car will not crank.  But cannot open car without emergency key and lights do not come on).    I am attempting to charge the battery with heavy duty charger, unsuccessfully.  I can get the lights to come on sometimes.  When I complained again at the dealer while waiting to get the battery checked last time, the salesman tried to sell me another car!!! This one is not paid for....it cost $10,000 more than a mustang, but would be safe and dependable for the family.
In April of 2017, I was able to trade the Volvo in for a Kia.
As we were about to trade, the head liner fell down.  On an internet search, we found that others have had this same problem.
You may also want to make sure that the trunk latch is working.
You will need to test doors and trunk while keys are out of range, as they automatically unlock doors and trunk as you approach.
The 66,617 mileage is the mileage just prior to trade in at 5.5 years. This is very low mileage for us. "

Priced up to $10K less than German competitors, while offering equal/better interior space, trunk space, safety features, comfort, build quality, reliability and styling.
The C70 does give up a bit to its competitors in terms of performance - but with the Polestar upgrade it is more powerful than a 328i, and hardly underpowered.
It doesn't have the handling of a BMW or Audi, but still fun to run through twisty roads and rides more comfortably.

At 49K just before warranty expired rear suspension failed (stabilizer bars bushings etc. )_  Destroyed new tires.  At 51k AC COMPRESSOR FAILED ONE THOUSAND MILES OUT OF WARRANTY.  At 55k headliner suddenly and completely detached.  At 60K Oxygen sensor failed.  At 65k brake caliper leaked and needed replacement.  At 72K car started shuddering....... left and right transaxles BOTH failed and needed to be replaced.  At 80k hard top started leaking.  At about 84K main seals failed very expensive $2K.   This card was serviced on schedule and well taken care of and has been a money pit.  I will NEVER buy a Volvo again.   Anyone considering buying a used C70 BEWARE.

UPDATE:  At 94k the hardtop convertible deployment mechanism failed dealer estimated $2500 to repair.  Certainly not from over use...I'd say we deployed the top a few times a month max.  So now we no longer have a functioning convertible.  Also the front headliner that THE DEALER replaced at 55k is slowly detaching in one corner.  At this point we are just letting our 16 year old drive it to school as long as the AC holds up...I am assuming the turbo or the tranny will go next ugh and we will likely donate it to charity since it has virtually no trade in value and I'd have to be crazy to put any more money into this car.  All this on a car that was bought new impeccably dealer maintained, and driven lightly.  Mistake not to trade it in at the first sign of trouble but my wife just didn't want to part with her red convertible.  To Volvo I say drop dead.

Upgraded the turbo 5  with the dealer-installed Polestar software. HP jumped to 272. Really helped on the torque and acceleration on the Interstate.

This car I thought I'd fall in love with; unfortunately not the case. The biggest issue was driver ergonomics. With the cruise control engaged, and time to spread out/relax....there was no where to go. Right leg hits the handbrake in the center console. Left leg hits hard aluminum on the interior door pull. Left forearm rests on hard plastic. Even had some cushions custom made which helped bit. But in the end just plain poor design. 

Another thing, pulling out in traffic. Front wheel drive, you had to pull out, turn, THEN accelerate. If you turned and accelerated, the car would chatter across the pavement. A bit disconcerting. 

Couple plusses. The front seats are GREAT. So are the brakes,

This is NOT a sports car. The cornering is poor, noticeable rollover. No nav system. Stereo surprisingly good. Car spent more time at the dealership for little mess. Expected more for 44K. "

I bought it because my other half fell in love with it and at the time I couldn't say no. Boy was I fool for that. This is the most boring car i've ever owned!!! I bought the car as a certified pre-owned and it had all the options, which was great, but all that didn't matter once I started having to drive it on a regular basis. The ride is somewhat smooth but you definitely don't feel like you are connected to the road when driving it. I got rid of my E46 BMW 325Ci w/sport package and OMG how I regret it!

I am now driving the C70 as my daily driver and I absolutely HATE this car! It handles like runny dog crap! Way too much body roll and clumsy handling, it does not corner well at all, and good luck if you need to do a u-turn. The turning radius is TERRIBLE, don't expect to do a quick U-turn in this car, instead be prepared to do a three point turn every single time, which is absolutely PATHETIC! I have started calling this the Volvo Town Car because it handles like a granny-mobile even though it is a small car.

The acceleration is sad and even with the Dealer optimized Polestar upgrade, which costs $1k dollars, it still lacks any real oomph other than making the tires chirp a little if you take off abruptly.
The transmission is garbage and does not change gears appropriately for the situation at hand. It upshifts way too quickly even when you are trying to accelerate and get into freeway traffic. I tried using the manual mode a few times and found it utterly useless and very backwards compared to any other european automobile I have driven. At steady cruising speeds on the highway it gets craptastic fuel economy, averaging about 22MPG and even worse with inner city driving (16mpg at best). The suspension is vile, you end up feeling every single damn bump in the road as if you were driving a go-kart. Also the car rattles like crazy when you hit a bump, which is a sure sign of crappy build quality, my 10 year old BMW never suffered such rattles. 
Visibility is total s*** due to the horrible placement of the rearview mirror and the door panels which come up to my shoulder. I'm 6'3"" if I move the seat up from the lowest position my head rubs the roof, which also leads to my next complaint. When putting the top up in this car I have had my head smashed twice. If you are a taller person you have to move your head slightly to the right, otherwise the roof line pillar in the top will come down on your head relatively hard when closing.

The only positive about this car is the upgraded factory sound system and the front seats are super comfy. The dials are pretty simple and the menu interface is great, but that is the only thing I will say that is nice about this horrible handling beast. The repair costs and amount of things that have gone wrong on this car are unforgivable and expensive to repair. The car has stalled out on me numerous times and when it is brought into the dealership they can't diagnose or duplicate the problem, the top has failed to close properly about 5 times now and even with adjustments it sometimes fails to latch properly. Water has been leaking in where the tops meets the windshield, even when it IS completely latched, and we can't seem to locate where it is coming in. I cannot wait to trade this POS in for a new BMW convertible. I've never had the lack of confidence and fear of a car breaking down as I have with this heap of trash and I have owned Jaguars, BMWs, and even an 05 Ford Mustang. Avoid this car at all costs! "

Let this review serve as neither of those on an 8-year old, daily-driven Volvo C70 with 120k miles on it and in need of a $2k maintenance visit, which we'll be doing.

First off, this car is a joy to own and drive once you get used to it.  The controls are different, but no more different than any of the other hard top convertible controls (Lexus' are unintuitive, BMW's are complicated--you'll get used to either once you drive it a while).  The sound system is great and Bluetooth works well.  The backseats are usable even when (a younger) grandma needs to install child seats twice a year and refuses to give up her convertible.  Styling looks great 8 years later, it is still comfortable and reliable, does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Kudos for Volvo for offering unique color combinations.  The seats are beautiful and more comfortable than any other brand hands down!  We didn't opt for the model with navi due to the cost of maintaining navigation subscriptions long term, them becoming obsolete, additional complexity, and unnecessarily complicated to use.  This car is not cutting edge, not especially sporty/ performance-minded (more of a Lexus competitor than BMW, Infiniti), but it is a very reliable, comfortable highway cruiser and does that job very well.

For the cons, it's nuts that Volvo doesn't have bi-xenon headlights or any safety equipment standard.  The good news, the car is cheaper to fix (bulbs are $25ish) and repair bills at the body shop are lower too.  Volvos need maintenance--all cars do.  There's only 2 dealers (both are sub-par IMO) and 2 Swedish specialists in my city, so you pay a little more.  Since out of warranty, we've replaced a battery, air conditioning switch, drive axle, a handful of bulbs (both headlights, tail light, rear turn signal), remote battery, emblem, fuses, a driver power seat regulator, tires, brakes, and fluids.  It's been a great car.  Repairs have cost slightly more than average but the frequency has been lower than average in my opinion.  It is sometimes difficult to find parts and more than one time the wrong part has come in.  The only outstanding repair that the car needs is about a third of one of the rear tail light LEDs is out (sometimes) and the part is not available.  It doesn't affect safety or drivability and has been that way for 3years and hasn't worsened.

Whether the car is dealer, mechanic, or personally serviced, if it's well taken care of, these are great cruisers!  Parts, bulbs, filters, etc. are available online for very reasonable prices and a lot of the easier repairs are so easy a caveman can do it.  Some repairs are extra complicated (cabin air filter), but most are fine.  The 120k service is expensive--it requires a timing belt, tensioners, water pumps, belts, both filters, few different fluid changes and runs about $2k, but it's a once (or twice if you LOVE your Volvo) in a lifetime of the car service.  Build and paint quality, fit and finish, etc. are all excellent as we don't care/ detail our cars physically like we should and they hold up quite well.  Tires are reasonable.  The C70 is a dying breed, but a car I would absolutely recommend, buy again, consider second hand, etc.  Crazy how cheap they are on the used market! "

I traded our '11 on one of the very last '13s in the area in Dec '13 and got an excellent price.  It's lacking a couple of things our earlier models had, namely Nav and super-duper audio(whatever the latest was called in '13...DynAudio no longer in use).  It's still(and again) a great cruiser, capable in-town vehicle and a blast to drive with the top down.  Yes, the suspension is more comfy than racy; but this is no track car.  The hardtop, while not silent, is solid and confidence-inspiring...with excellent visibility for a drop-top.  Gas mileage for us has been a solid 25mpg average on 87 octane fuel(Top Tier almost exclusively ).  Road trips are much closer to 30mpg.  I wouldn't mind eliminating some of the wheel-spin under acceleration and cornering; but it IS a FWD after all.  The back seat is for the pup, so humans don't regularly ride in ours, although there's enough room for non-giant folks on trips of shorter duration.  IF Volvo still made the C70, I reckon we would start looking about now(57k miles); but, alas, it may(will?) be a few more years before Volvo gets into the drop -top business again.  IF the next gen is anything like the current C70; we'll be in line for one!!!

Sept 2019 Update:
Well, we have 68k miles on the C70 now and still as happy as ever to own such a nice vehicle.  As the car ages a bit more, necessary repairs/maintenance will take a little of the ""fun"" out of the equation; but I can't complain.  Even with some parking lot mishaps and three scraped corner panels, the main body of the car looks great and we get plenty of compliments on its appearance.  The operation of the top still continues to impress folks and awe youngsters :) 

Had to replace the oil filter housing thingy at a cost of $300+, so that wasn't fun and the 70k mile service will be a little spendy.  Still not a bad price for such a safe and capable vehicle!!!   I keep looking on used car sites just in case I can find a '13 that has been a garage queen for someone...maybe with half the miles of ours ;)    Until then, we will keep on enjoying the top-down experience and overall driving satisfaction provided by our C70!

March '20 Update:
No real changes except for a couple of gremlins showing up.  Windshield washers are not working...not sure where the problem lies.  Getting a bit of stutter/hesitation on low-end mild acceleration; but we're due for a plug change at the next service...maybe a fuel system clean as well.  Despite these little bugs, this car remains a pleasure to drive(especially early morning or evenings with the top down!).  We haven't kept a car this long since our '91 Miata stayed with us for nine years @ 135k miles.  Not sure we will go THAT long; but we sure do like this car!!!

Sept. '20  Update
""BlueBell"" is now seven years old with 75K miles and it's now MY daily driver.  MyDarling got a 2020 XC40 for her commuter-mobile and she loves it!!
A few more repairs have been needed on BlueBell; but she's running great and is still a joy to drive with the top down.  Did a quick 150-mile trip last week and the car is still silky-smooth @ 75mph and feels like it could run all day.  Averaged well over 30mpg on that trip(we are roughly 25mpg in daily driving of stop-and-go and 65mph highways).  
Next service is likely to be a transmission drain/fill, although some Volvo experts don't want to mess with what is working fine.  Had to replace two motor-mounts, some sort of check-valve in the windshield washer line, rear brakes and one strange cooling system hose.  None of these items are cheap on a Volvo.  I'm now seeing a local independent Volvo wrench for service, ""maybe"" saving a few bucks along the way.  It wouldn't surprise me if the suspension might need some updating in the next year or so; although it's performing fine in day-to-day driving.  New plugs a few months ago didn't make quite the difference I thought they would; but the engine is running fine and the average MPG numbers are good.
I try to pay attention to the top and its operation...all is running smoothly at this point.  Keeping up with the lubing and cleaning of the various points of concern is the main thing and ours shows no signs of trouble!  Still super solid with the top up or down!
IF I could find a garage-queen C70 with maybe half the miles, I would consider trading; but this one is aging well, IMO, even if she does need some attention from time to time! "
64,C70,2013,4.2, 01/12/2019,Dave Nau,T5 2dr Convertible (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),8 of 8 people found this review helpful,"It's my Convertible, Hobby Car, and Truck",3,"I am perhaps not the usual Volvo C70 owner.  When my 2011 Honda CR-V started to have serious engine and air conditioner problems, that were going to be over $5000 to fix, I decided to try to find a convertible with a 2000 pound tow rating to replace the Honda.  I've owned five convertibles in my lifetime and it was time for another.  However, I have two small boats: one rig is 1000 pounds and the larger one is 1500 pounds.  The 2006-2013 Volvo C70 is the only modern convertible with a 2000 pound tow rating (braked trailer) and a 1640 pound tow rating (un-braked trailer). Both my un-braked rigs are under 1640 pounds, so they are with-in the specification.  With the C70 (purchased in April, 2018 with 62,000 miles on it), I now have a car that is my only car, and as such, it is my daily driver, my convertible, my hobby car, and my truck for towing.  It tows both my boats very well, much better than the CR-V did, runs on regular gas just fine (Volvo specified minimum grade of 87), has front-wheel drive for good wintertime traction, has a big trunk, a reasonable back seat with LATCH attachments for the grand-kids, plenty of room in front for me at 6"" 4"" and weighing 275 pounds, and is a great looking car.  The convertible top works flawlessly, the Bridge of Weir leather is high quality, the car only uses about 1/4 of a quart of synthetic oil between the 10,000 mile oil change intervals, and I have an independent shop with-in walking distance of me that maintains it at a reasonable cost. For towing, I lock it in 4th gear of the 5-speed automatic, run at 60MPH, and it pulls the boats great.  I get 32MPG highway, 25MPG just driving around town, and for towing, I get 20-22MPG depending on terrain. Curt makes an 1 1/4"" receiver hitch for it that mounts completely behind the rear bumper cover, with only the small receiver portion of the hitch showing, and it's not very visible. To see my trailer when backing up to retrieve a boat, I just retract the top and thus have great visibility.  In the 18,000 miles I've put on it, my only real repair has been an air conditioner pressure switch, and it was not very expensive to get fixed. I have made one modification, since these these cars tend to run at the high end of the Volvo spec for negative camber in the rear suspension, and thus often cause premature tire wear and tire noise after about 10K miles on a pair of rear tires, as mine did.  I fixed this problem by installing a a pair of aftermarket adjustable rear upper control arms, plus two new rear tires.  The alignment shop that installed them then dialed in the negative camber to the low end of the spec (about -.7 to -1.0 degree camber), fixing the unadjustable -2.6 degrees my car had.  (The spec is -.7 to -2.7 degrees, but more than about -1.4 degrees causes the premature inner tire wear and roaring noise.)  I've put 16,000 miles on since the fix and it's still quiet, with the tires are not showing unusual wear, so all good.  Also, pre-2013 cars had a firmware problem in the satellite radio portion of the stereo that would run the battery down if left parked for a week.  The 2013's have a firmware fix for this from the factory.  Also, 2013's are the only models that support bluetooth music streaming from a phone or other device.  If you are like me, and can only have one car, but need it to do all this, the 2013 Volvo C70 is the way to go.  It was the last model year they were built and mine was made in December, 2012.  I love it. I plan to drive it until it hits at least 250K miles.
July, 2020 Update: Car is still as I reviewed two years ago.  Only component failure was an A  pressure switch, which was not real expensive to replace.  I still need to watch the negative rear camber on alignments by staying at the low range of the spec (keep at -.7 to -1.2). "

If you do live in a mountain region with snow consider the T6 as the front wheels do spin even with the DTSC system.
The interior on the S80 puts the competition to shame as it is true wood and designed with incredible detail.

I test drove the BMW 328, BMW 335, Acura TL for reference.
After my previous experience I wouldn't recommend an Audi as even up to the model I recently owned they have many electrical problems.  "

The seats are very comfortable, and fuel economy is reasonable for this class of car.  For some odd reason you have to pull twice on the door handle to get the door to open.  The first pull to unlock, and the second to actually open the door.  Adaptive cruise control is my favorite tech feature, although if you come to a complete stop it disengages after a couple of seconds.  Being a tech nut, my experience with the infotainment system, including navigation, has been a huge let down.  Few road labels on moving map.  Inputs not intuitive.  No touch screen, so controls are clunky.  Menus for settings etc, were hard even for the sales reps and service people to figure out.  Voice commands are slow and plodding.  After fresh navigation update the new database installed still had incorrect information on road accessibility.  Even major freeway intersections were incorrectly configured on the map.  Now get this, navigation updates have to be done with car running, and at a stop, and it takes several hours to do it, seriously.  Also, if you turn off your engine and want to listen to music the car’s infotainment system will turn off after a few minutes, even though the energy required to listen to music is relatively small.  Smart phone connectivity is unreliable.  So for a car that claims to be tech savvy by those that represent it, I was very disappointed to find out how backward the infotainment system actually is.  Which is a shame seeing as how the rest of the car is pretty good. "

The S80 e-Drive Platinum 2015.5 is under-marketed and you likely aren't chomping at the bit to buy one.  Do not make the mistake of believing what is said about the performance of the professional reviewer even if you are an aggressive driver.   I wanted a car that met the following criteria:  going to be around for 10 years, protect me from the bad drivers on the road today, deliver zippy performance,  provide efficient gas mileage and be comfortable and fun to drive.  I am so glad i got in the S80 at the dealer.  I almost got the S60 but decided the 80 was larger and a better fit for me since i'm 6'2 and over 200.  My son is already 6' at age 14 so space would have been tight for the family in the S60.  

I looked at lots of cars and realized i'm not the guy for those that look pompous.  I wanted understated, classy, strong value and safe.   I've got 10k on this now and not one thing has caused me an issue other than figuring out how to setup my Volvo connection account.  Their customer service solved the problem very quickly.   Everyone that rides in it is amazed and says things like ""well, I never"" and ""beautiful"" and ""what kind of car is this again?"".    The technology is significantly advanced over the 2015.   

I would purchase it again in a heartbeat.   Two complaints.  First, there is no defined place for sunglasses and they go into a compartment behind the radio or the central bin between the seats.  The compartment behind the radio is most convenient but they fly out when you swing around a sharp corner fast.  I do that a lot.  Second, the cup holders for the front seat are too close together.  As a result, my venti iced latte and my wife's drink like to pop the lid off one another.  

Take one for a nice long drive and see if you can return it to the lot.  I could not and look forward to handing this off to my oldest when she graduates college in 7 years. "

The 2015.5 Platinum Drive-E is awesome. The gas mileage is impressive - I got as much as 38.5 mpg on the highway. City mileage generally is not near the EPA estimate of 25 - more like 19.  It is a very understated car - most people do not realize what an exceptional car it is - great ride and comfort. The folding rear seats give you additional room when you need to move something. The headlights are absolutely awesome! - They are very bright and turn as you turn the vehicle. I can attest to the fact that it is a safe car. I was in a major accident and my S80 was totaled (not my fault - another guy ran a red light). It did exactly what it was supposed to do - side curtain airbags deployed but the front ones did not (since by then my speed was reduced when I hit a pole). I am glad the front air bags did not go off when they did not have to - my head never hit the steering wheel. Even though the front-end of the car sustained substantial damage, the air bags did not go off when they didn't need to. 

My only major complaint about the car was the Volvo On Call App. It was one of the main reasons I bought the car - ability to remote start, send destinations from smart phone to GPS, etc. But the connectivity and Volvo support was not very good. Even though reliability was only around 60-70%, I needed it for the remote start. Prior to the accident I renewed my Volvo On Call for 54 months. I paid $600 for 54 months. After the accident, I realized I had 48 months left on the service that I would not be able to use. I called Volvo to get a refund of the remaining time since I obviously would not be able to use the service since the car was totaled. Volvo said too bad - we have your $600 and are going to keep it even though we know we can't provide you the service.  So as a word of CAUTION, it may be tempting to renew for a longer period of time because $11.11 per month (for 54 months) is more reasonable than $16.67 per month (1 year renewal). However, if anything happens to your car, you could be out a lot of money. It basically cost me $100 per month for the service (used 6 of the 54 months). Not worth $16.67 per month for the service and absolutely not worth $100 per month!! Also, as I understand it, if you sell the car, it is not transferable and the new owner will have to buy the same service again. So not good if you think you might sell the car. Just something to consider should you decide to renew. I was extremely disappointed in Volvo's response to my request for a refund. I will never ever make that mistake again! I have another car (different manufacturer) with a similar app and it is substantially more reliable and substantially less expensive. So I know there are manufacturers out there that have Apps that work well. "

And - at least 10-15K less expensive than a comparable BMW or MBZ.   The best 5 star crash safety ratings too! The only 'minor' issue is that I know these cars lose value quickly - which makes them an absolute STEAL of a used car.  I plan to keep this car for at least 5 years so no worries about that for me.

Specifically, it tracks down the road like it is on rails, it has the most comfortable front seat I have ever sat in (still comfortable after a all day 8-hour drive), and it gets good gas mileage (about 35 to 37 miles per gallon when traveling on the interstate at 65 to 75 mph).

The mpg was a pleasant surprise considering the EPA rating (22 mpg hwy) and some of the reviews.

The turbo engine significantly improves this vehicle: quieter, smoother, more than adequate acceleration and no noticeable reduction in mpg. The 3.2 is slow, buzzy/noisy and it gets lousy mpg (worst of all worlds).
You're always aware of the engine working at the limits of its capacity to move this heavy vehicle. And, while the T6's base price is $6k higher, it comes standard with AWD and premium/leather package which are nearly always added to the 3.2, so the ""base"" sticker price of the T6 and 3.2 are essentially the same before other options. Why not get the bigger engine? "

Not only were prices slashed, but quality and features improved.
I picked up an XC70 T6 cheaper than last year's base model.
Volvo hired a good CEO, and the workers in Gothenburg are happier than they were under Ford.

Interior feels much more luxurious and refined; also appears somewhat roomier.
Exterior design mostly improved on the previous generation, except for those silvery things around fog lights.

Having had only Volvo wagons since 1980, I have to say that this 2011 seems more solid and heavy (in a good way) than any of my previous models or later models I have driven as loaners. Generally reliability has been good--with a few 

exceptions: At 85,000 miles, the engine started to use a lot of oil. Volvo examined it and replaced the entire engine. They told me that it was a bad batch of piston rings that was responsible, so this wasn't really a ""bad"" feature of the car. Volvo has never been able to properly balance the wheels, so I have learned to live with a slight steering wheel vibration at around 60 mph. They said the rims were distorted and sent them for repair; but that didn't help. Tire Rack replaced all 4 tires TWICE, with no improvement. The design of the rims is such that mud stays put and makes the balance problem markedly worse. I have never been totally happy with the brakes, but a recent full brake replacement has fixed this problem. There is a really stupid feature of the software: when the fog lights are on, they go out when high beams are selected, but don't come back on when you return to low beams. Interestingly, the second identical model I just purchased doesn't do this! Finally, I am singularly unimpressed with the headlights, specially the high beams. I've replaced the low-beam bulbs with high intensity ""silver tip"" bulbs, but see hardly any difference. There are no high intensity replacements for the high-beam bulbs, so when I drive at night plplllI envy the bright headlights of much cheaper cars.

LlLL2nd Review 9/1/16:
L having now owned my 2nd 2011 XC70 T6 for about 6 months, I can add a little to this review. The 2nd XC70 seems just as well built as my first one. I do, however, miss the folding rear-view mirrors and the front seats don'r seem to be quite as comfortable; but since the car has less than 30,000 miles, it could just be a break-in phenomenon. The headlights are markedly superior to those on the first car (see above review), even with standard bulbs, and there are no problems with wheel balance or braking (see above review). The silly fog-light phenomenon I described for the first car is also absent.  In summary, the 2nd car is just as good as the first, and just as robust and ""heavy"" in a good way. I'd like to replace the first car with another 2011 (it has 130,000 miles); but I don't think I could find a low-mileage 2011 again.

Since the first review (see above), the first car has had the following major repairs (all covered by an extended warranty policy): New A/C compressor, new motor for driver's side mirror (motor failed). "

I test drove the 3.2 twice and the difference in performance was significant.   Also like all Volvos, the XC70 is loaded with safety, convenience, and technology.

I have owned cars that I ran for over 230K mi and never had stuff like this break. 

update:  I saw that the rear coil spring was not a strut type yet, they wanted 1 1/2 hours labor and they wanted to replace both plus alignment. A simple trailing arm suspension with separate tube shock, once unbolted allows the spring to be removed by hand.  The ""top hat"" to the coil spring was rusty which I find unacceptable for a supposedly premium car with such low miles.  The quality is missing.  Don't buy a Volvo. I bought the spring (had to wait 7 days for it to be shipped)  and put it in myself in about 45 min. once I had the car jacked on stands.  See You tube for demo of someone doing this. 

By the way, I consider the RAD sensor to be part of the smog equipment.  This is supposed to be warrenteed for 10 years by law but they wouldn't cover it. "

It's not that I'm a fanboi, they just best fit my current needs as family commuter and weekend sports equipment hauler. In fact, I shopped around A LOT before replacing my 2011 S60 T6 AWD with the 2015 XC70 T6 AWD. I'm not a fan of SUV looking vehicles but I require good rear leg room and ample cargo capacity. I also prefer more ground clearance than sedans+ as pot holes and high/steep curves have ruined my day in lower sitting cars. The wagon body-style is more popular in Europe and that suites me just fine. If you'd prefer a car but need more room and like the idea of extra ground clearance, you owe it to yourself to test drive an XC70. "

I leased new XC70 2015 T6 AWD in and I have 15k miles on it. It is great car to some extend regardless of the price tag. It has unique combination of performance, luxury and utility and is well built. So what's the problem?

Soon after I leased the car local dealership was closed and I learned that according to ""Volvo's policies"" I have to drive 200 miles distance to the next dealership to get scheduled maintenance. Is this reasonable? I tried working though Volvo customer service, but have been politely stonewalled, the company has no method of filing customer complaints. They all come back to the same person. 

March 2016 update
The car behaves perfectly, after putting 20k miles on it, I like it more than right after the purchase. No mechanical issues or any issues. This car is really well built even comparing to previous Volvos that I had., Mileage 19 mpg in mixed city/freeway driving using premium gasoline. I changed oil three times and did tires balancing at about 17k miles.  Further impressions - this is not performance ""drivers car"".  But it got enough power to leave many ""drivers cars"" behind.  You just use this power not for driving fun but for driving comfort. That's probably a good definition for this car - very comfortable. I decided to keep the car for a bit longer and bought out the lease. 

As for Volvo fixing customer service issues - there is no visible progress, they dropped all their customers after closing some dealerships.

March 2017 update
The car still is as good as new and I am liking it more with every month passing by. Still getting between 19 to 20 mpg and it is about 25k miles now. There is Volvo recall to upgrade the software for AWD system. Well  now I do nave to drive 200 miles to closes dealership. "

For me, this car provides sufficient power, great handling and comfort. It is full of metal and won't bend when you lean on it like my last Subaru Outback. I am surprised when auto reviewers say the engines are not adequate-I have to wonder why someone would buy and drive a station wagon like you would a performance sport car. Times have changed-driving is more self defensive and spent staying away from people texting and talking on their phones. This is a safe vehicle. It is fun to drive and easy to keep in the lanes. You will love it and it is easy/pleasurable to drive.  I am getting decent gas mileage (23 mpg) overall and I haven't even broken it in yet. I highly recommend this car-it will put a smile on your face every time you get behind the wheel. "

We chose this car after purchasing two BMW X1s in 2014 and 2015. I was a bit worried about the mpg and that I would be consuming more gas and hurting the environment. Well after our first major road trip of 430 miles in CA from N. Ca, through Sacramento to Palo Alto, I was impressed. You have to know that this road trip is primarily major state and federal highways, on roads that are very bumpy, can be stressful, and very heavy with traffic. We obtained an overall round-trip gas mileage of 25.6 mpg with cruising speeds of 70-80 mph, and considerable stop and go on these interstates. Frankly consider this route to be one of the worst traveling itinerary  that you could ever drive and put a car through. 
The best attribute of this car is the Volvo front car seats that are likely the most comfortable in a car. We purchased the car mostly for the front car seats as my wife has spinal issues that causes her great pain and discomfort about the third hour of a road trip. The seat comfort was the best of what could be expected given my wife's chronic aliments. I cannot say this for the back car seats as they are average, and the designers could have engineered more leg room for the rear passengers. Don't get the wrong impression, it is still better than the X1s that we have experienced.
The auto runs smooth, plenty of acceleration, low road noise, and takes the highway bumps with little lingering memory. What I might be critical of is the steering as it is a bit light and you don't have intuitive feeling you get out of a performance car such as a BMW X1. The handling around curves is slightly above average, but you should slow down a bit if it is a tight curve as there is a slight body lean and response for you to take it more slower than a performance car.
I have only 700 miles on the car and as you know, nothing is broken in yet, the engine especially. I will look forward to more (pleasurable) road trips and I anticipate that I will find the car much more superior and also expect to obtain slightly higher mpg on long road trips. There are no available safety ratings for this model, but it is a Volvo. The exterior body is very solid and the finish is excellent. We have learned much after purchasing three new cars in the last 24 months and anyone purchasing should do their homework in regards to invoice price, reviews of the car handling, etc. "

It’s used as a truck in Europe, the Russians abuse it & makes YouTube sensations. Family tow stuff with it, Scotland Yard police use it as police car, you name it. It’s just a beast. The ride is a bit like a boat, at low speed, but, at highway, it feels firm & goes over potholes with good isolation. Front & rear sensor helps a lot. Steering is not light but not heavy, it has a smooth, rubbery feel but definitely like like a F250 loose. In other words, long distance driving it’s not tiring. Acceleration is amazing at high way. Comfy seat no issues. Infotainment & voice control are reliable to use once you learn it. Mine has 29000 miles, there’s a bit of rear seat area squeaking but I’m yet to investigate why, could be just natural built quality. Note that my previous 2017 V60 CC feels tighter in built quality. Two gripes about Volvo Bluetooth, when using iPhones to make call, the voice vol of the other person is so low that it’s practically useless.

I purchased a 2015 XC70 T6 Polestar. It is my third Volvo, currently has 20,000 miles. No problems. Lots of room for hauling. I like the XC70 because the rear seats fold flat, so you have over 5 feet length of flat area. I hauled a Stickley collector bookshelf over 1200 miles, for example. Also great for hauling dogs, and their crates. In my opinion this is the best road trip car -- ever. Super fast and hugs the road. Rain and snow are no problem for this gem. Traded in my 2009 S60 with 55,000 miles. I still miss that car, never a problem. My 2000 S70 sold to mom and dad, has over 120,000 miles, no problems. My experience with Volvo has been outstanding. The service from Volvo dealers has also been more than excellent. Sadly, I traded in my Volvo XC70 for a Porsche Macan S, that I like very much, partly because it is rear wheel drive based. I miss my Volvo, and think about her often.  If I had had more money, and a bigger garage, I would not have let her go. Somebody got an amazing car! "

Loved it, so comfortable, great pick speed, cargo space, beautiful interior and exterior.  I have tire insecurity and no matter how well everything else works not knowing when your tires will get a flat or wear out so quickly, makes me feel unsafe, insecure about driving it, especially any road trips I take, which I do a lot living in New England.  Three out of the four tires got flats, one day when I was picking up my dad in another state, I went to replace the tire and they couldn't get it for 3 days, we had nowhere to stay and my Dad was very ill.  At that time there was only one tire you could use to replace it.  Luckily the garage next door plugged it but I drove 2 1/2 hours back home white knuckled with my elderly father.  It was nerve-racking.  Got two more flats, all different tires.  So starting with the four original tires, plus three, thats seven tire in less than 4 years and just was told I needed to replace all 4 tires this winter, that 11 tires in 4 years...so now instead of dealing with the lack of concern and attention to a customer's obvious issues with tires, alignment I'm trading in this car for one I feel confident and safe traveling at night, on a highway or back country roads.  Update: got rid of it and got an Audi Q7 in January 2019 "

Didn't rate maintenance cost/reliability as I've only had it about 6 weeks, thus no experience with those issues.  Certainly seems solid and runs like a champ.  Bought the extended warranty, as am sure it is expensive to work on, based on past experience, if one wants to use Volvo parts.   Hoping it lasts another 20 years.  :-)  Due to the extensive safety features, full insurance coverage on this car was less than on the V70.  My mileage estimate figure isn't accurate, as I don't track that, but the form won't let me leave it blank.  Go with the mfg. specs, I guess, or find a review from someone who tracks that.

You see, a couple of years ago I had to bite the bullet and trade in my 08 XC90 for a Chrysler Town and Country minivan because of the kids. As minivans go, it's great, but... it's a minivan. So for my 40th, my wife said that we could trade in her '15 Subaru Forester for the new XC90! I test drove the 90 and it was great - really nice, but just a little too fancy. See, I'm an avid fly fisherman and I was having trouble picturing this very fancy SUV with muddy boots and waders in the back and mud all over the sides. Besides, I think the new '90 lost a lot of its ""Volvoness"". The XC70 on the other hand - beautiful classic Volvo. Just as comfortable on the side of a river as it is going out to dinner and a show in the city. So I test drove it and fell in love. The whole experience made it feel like the car was made for me. So we traded in the Forester, which I never quite fit into comfortably (I'm 6', 280lbs, but I carry it well ;) ), and leased the XC70. I picked up the car on New Year's Eve, 2015 and have been loving every bit of it for about a month now. The built in booster seats are awesome for the kids, the fold down passenger seat means I don't have to break down my fly rods to get them in the car, the iPhone app is ridiculously useful, I drove it in the Blizzard of '16 and it handled it like the ""blizzard"" of '15, I was a little worried about the lack of touch screen but having gotten used to the controls on the steering wheel I found them to be so much easier - especially with the rhino hooves that I have for hands! Every time - Every single time - I get into it, I smile. I smile, and I take the long way everywhere I go. Hey, with these gas prices, what's stoppin' me? "

This is the last, don't let it get away.  My 5th Volvo and the best yet.  7K miles on it so far.  For a huge wagon, the steering is responsive with good feedback.  Breaks are awesome.  They have finally eliminated the torque steer, totally, which was present on my 1998 V70XC and worse on my 2007 XC70.  the 2007 had terrible wet braking, the 2016 has great wet road brakes.  Very quiet, very comfortable, good electronics.  Better than 27mpg in mostly highway driving.  Next year's 2017 cross country costs 18 thousand dollars more and may not be as good.  The 2017 has a hatchback, cutting cargo room, and a 4cyl engine which may not be as smooth, at least, not yet.  This 2016 has the tried and true 5 banger.  The only downside is that the 6 speed auto is a little reluctant to downshift, you have to mash the throttle a little or shift manually.  Oh, and the active safety already prevented a collision for me, accelerating onto a highway, checking the left mirror, did not notice the stopped traffic ahead until the Volvo applied the brakes for me.

Before buying also considered a Subaru Forester and Subaru Crosstrek.  What sold me on the Volvo was the longer warranty period - 4 years/50,000 miles; 12 year rust protection - I live in Western Massachusetts where they salt and sand profusely in the winter; and the alloy wheels.  The interior is so luxurious to me and the people at Gengras Volvo in East Hartford gave me the best deal compared to 2 other Volvo dealers.  I won't really know how the AWD does in winter because I just got the car - so far the handling is stable; and because the wheelbase and size are larger than my old V40 I am adjusting to how it handles with parking and taking the curves - still breaking it in with only 302 miles so far.  The other thing that sold me was the cargo design and layout - my goal is to get to some National Parks to camp in the future - and the 250 horsepower and ability to tow were also part of my decision.  And I love the turbo - my V40 has such great pep - and I have loved that capacity.  The XC70 does weigh more - so haven't tested the pep of the turbo yet - still being cautious as I adjust to the new height - but love being able to just get in the car - rather than have to lower my body as I did in my V40.  And I just get out - so getting in and out is pretty neutral.  Love the proximity package and can see that when my hands are full it will be a blessing; the tailgate with auto up and down - fantastic! And the flat trunk - great for tailgating and picnics.  All the new technology - navigation; phone; etc. - I am still learning how to use this - so can't really make a call on this yet - plus this stuff didn't exist on my 2001 V40. And have to get the new garage door opener programmed yet - that's how new it is to me.

One year later - and I still LOVE my new XC 70!!  Currently, I have over 18,000 miles! The XC70 was a real champion in the winter - I was on a small hill and the lead car at the stop light was spinning and going no where - there was one car in between - I backed up my XC70 and with my AWD went around both cars up the same hill and went on my way!! Then I drove through a blowing snow storm down to New Jersey and again, the XC 70 made the trip - it is wonderful and the AWD is fantastic!  Before buying I had checked out the difference in the Haldex versus symmetrical drive - and I am convinced that the Haldex is the way to go.  Over the summer I was also able to test out the turbo when passing on some two lane roads in North Carolina, Virginia, and Ohio and it has pep to get around when needed - on two lane roads I don't take time to pass - so the turbo punch does an amazing job and does it well considering the size and weight.  Still leaning to adjust to the new features, but the back up camera is one that has helped so much - it is a great feature and the hands free telephone is wonderful.  Other features that have come in handy - the remote start and the ability to lock the car from afar or to be sure it's locked - especially after parking at the airport.  Still adjusting to the higher center of gravity - especially as I was driving through West Virginia on some very long up and down curves - but it performed beautifully.  The car has been to Northern Michigan, across part of Canada and New York state!  When going across Canada - I was trying to figure out how to get the odometer to switch to kilometers per hour - still have to look that one up - so I turned to the fuel consumption feature where I based my best guess when it indicated I was consuming 100 kmh to estimate the speed I should be going.  Compared to my old low road hugging V40 - it takes time to learn how to steer a car with a higher center of gravity and higher ground clearance - which I need for the snow - but as I am learning - the car is performing beautifully.  And I am so happy with the service department at the Gengras Volvo dealer in East Hartford.   One year later - and know I made the right decision to buy the XC70!!  I can't believe they still don't make this car!

Okay, my odometer now reads 28,921 - I have been racking up the miles. Still love my XC70 and it has taken everywhere I need to go up and down the East coast - summer, winter, fall and spring. And amazingly it still cranked this winter when the temperatures hung in the -10 to -18 range for three weeks in the morning. The folks at Gengras Volvo are still doing a great job for all me service and I couldn’t be happier with my “new” Volvo.

My odometer now reads over 81,000 miles and still love my car and am totally thrilled with the visibility.  I am a short person and the ability to see is obstructed by cars with those swept up backs - but this car still has great windows to see all around.  And it can be a real work horse when you have to move boxes and load up the back.  I am still so thrilled to own this car! "

This car was superior to Highlander, Outback, V60, and a few other mid range SUV's that I had a chance to test drive. Seat comfort is equal to our 2013 Sienna Limited. Road noise in XC70 is minimal. This car is a refreshing alternative to cookie cutter Outbacks and SUV's. Audio controls are dated but sound system is excellent. I have to say that I feel much safer driving this very solid wagon.

The vehicle was bought back by Volvo under the CPO warranty at approximately 67,000 miles because of the concerning oil consumption issue they could not resolve after many visits and about six weeks with my car sitting at the shop waiting for a backordered replacement engine. After much consideration, I replaced the vehicle with an equivalent 2014 model, which is the first year of a minor design refresh. This model has been considerably more reliable in all respects. I cannot recommend the 2012 based on the numerous quality issues and the oil consumption problem that was specific to very early second-generation S60s. 

Original review: 
I have owned nothing but Volvos. That said, I'm a bit of a car guy and know the comparisons between my 2012 S60 T5 and its competitors. While it may not handle as tightly as a comparable Mercedes or BMW, a T5 beats a base 3-series or C-Class hands-down when it comes to speed and comfort. It's also a sharp-looking car. My primary motivation for purchasing this vehicle was because it was the second safest car ever tested by the IIHS (next to the Tesla Model S) at the time. I bought it certified pre-owned from a Volvo dealer with about 30,000 miles in 2014. It has the premium package (sunroof, leather, power passenger seat) and climate package (heated seats, headlight washers, rain-sensing wipers). The draw to the CPO car was the 100,000-mile/7-year drivetrain warranty. While I adore this car, I am also very, very glad I have the extended warranty. I don't think I've ever had to take a car into the shop so often. At the time I'm writing this, I have taken the car in four times to fix a leak in the passenger floorboard that they cannot identify (I will give the dealer credit for their exhaustive efforts with this). The silver trim on the steering wheel and console began to peel, which they replaced. They also replaced a broken air vent. One leather panel on the backseat has begun to flake while the ones beside of it have not. It's obvious to me that the tiny panel in the middle is made of inferior material to those surrounding it. The dealer would not address this because they ""found evidence"" that my dog had ridden in the backseat. Most problematic is that the oil pressure warning came on 4,000 miles after my most recent service, meaning that it was four (of five) quarts low. It goes in later this week to have that issue figured out. I maintain this car well, having my services done when (or before) they're due, and only use synthetic oil. It shouldn't be having these problems. But most importantly to me, I'm safe, comfortable, have the power to escape a treacherous situation, and look damn good doing it. But, of course, it is as I'm on my way to the dealership for the millionth time for warranty work. "

Before buying we also test drove the T6, which was AWESOME, but more car than we needed. The T5 is so much fun to drive and so well-built that I have a feeling our enthusiasm will last long after our last car payment.

It looked good until someone sat in the seat and now it started to crack in other spots. The car has 16,000 mile on it. Now the dealer wants to replace the cracked vinyl for $850 but will take off the $75 initialled paid. It looks terrible. I have no choice but to fix it. "

I can say the Volvo beats the BMW in every area.
The S60 is a very fun car to drive, the interior is very comfortable well layed out and easy to use.
The safety features are first rate.
We test drove both the T5 and T6 but like the T6 much better, it just has a better feel on the road and the T6 is much more smoother than the T5.
This is a great car for the value, with many items that come standard vs. others like BMW and Audi. Engine uses regular and the 5 year/50,000 mile maintenance care is excellent.
I highly recommend this car.

Once the plugs were replace with OEM Volvo plugs it ran as always, like a watch. It will out run many BMWs and is amazingly stable on the road. The ONLY complaint is that given the stiff suspension and the low profile tires it goes through tires like a banshee. I have tried every tire from Michelin to the low end Chinese brands and it seems to make no difference, so I have given up and get the cheapest Z rated tires with a 40K warranty. Here is the kicker: I probably won't buy another new Volvo, but if I do, it will only because we would like to do another European delivery. I don't like the 4 cylinder engines, and the reports suggest that as expected, too much work is being done from too small of a displacement over the long hall especially with the high boost that they are using. So, the reason I am on this site is that I am going to buy another early version (up to 2104) S 60 R Design, 
but I intend to keep and  blueprint Borky as well when he breaks (which he may never do!)

Update. The S60 R-Design is still running great, at 192,000 miles, the only change is that we have signed up to buy a V90 using European Delivery in the spring. We test drove the 2019 model V90 R-design and I must admit the thing accelerates like a bat out of hell. I still worry about the amount of work the 4 cylinder is doing, but it is my wife's car and she does not abuse a car like I do. We have a 2009 2.5 S60 that she drive and it has 160,000 miles and still run perfectly so I am fairly sure the V90 will last a long time. 

To this day, I cannot understand why more people don't do the European Delivery program. Perhaps they are afraid of driving in Europe, but given the price reduction +/- 7%, the free airline tickets to and from Europe, the fact that everything is taken care of for you, it is silly not to do this. "

I knew of their existence but never did a double take. My company leases their vechicles to the employees as a company vehicle. Then when mileage hits 85-90k miles, they first offer it to the original driver of our company, then to any other employee in the company. I just happened to check the listings in Phoenix, AZ and the first one on the list was a 2012 Volvo S60 T5 Flamenco Metallic Red. Then I saw it was our branch manager. I walked over and asked him how he liked the car and said he loved it and threw me the keys and said ""see for yourself"". I was so excited once I sat in the amazing leather cockpit and slapped in the boxy key and hit start. He had a smile on his face as he walked away knowing I would probably enjoy the drive. The handling was great! The acceleration was great! Oh, then I noticed sport mode. That really helped me decide about the purchase. So after cranking the 8 speaker stereo with upgraded 160 watt amp, and opening and closing the sunroof / moonroof...I was hooked. I kinda said under my breathe...Volvo, for life. I have had the car now for about 1 month and I am still not tired of driving it. The controls in the console are easy to use. The power seats are a treat. The solid state hard drive I plugged in to the USB port in the center hidden console supplies me with 256GB of tunes that will last on any road trip without repeating a song. By the way, the first thing I did for maint was replace the headlights with a little whiter shades, replaced the spark plugs with double platinum. Replace the cabin filter (not fun at all). And polish up the leather seats for a nice new look. I did notice that the newer 2014-2016 speedometer cluster was easy to swap out but a few features would not show up so I decided to keep the old cluster and enjoy the simple yet semi-sporty look. I also did opt in on a very good deal for the 2 year extended warranty that covers major repairs.  Hoping to get a good 3 or 4 years from this beautiful piece of machinery.  Happy 2018! "

Needing a new car & my recent experience with the A4, it gave me a good reference point/comparison to the S60. Anyway, for ""me/myself & I"", the Volvo S60 T5 was ""much better"" than the A4 for city and highway driving. Also, it handled very good (not as good as the Germans, but good enough) and provided better steering feel, a more solid feel/smoother ride, quieter cabin, better seats, and ""just enough"" power to have some fun.

I was advised to look at the S60, but wasn't real interested. Well, out of respect, I did take a look. Indeed, I sat in its sumptuous leather seats then put the car through the paces. I was blown away. How had I never taken a close look at this car before now? Maybe the Volvo reputation for safety wasn't enough to catch my eye? Hmm. Whatever the case, I could not be more thrilled with my S60 T5. Luxurious, fun, fast, economical, and a badge that commands respect. I am now a Volvo fan. A BIG one. Absolutely love this car.

***UPDATE***
I now have 92,000 trouble-free miles on my S60 and I am pleased beyond words. It has exceeded my expectations in every way. I DO wish that mine had navigation and a back-up camera, but I bought it knowing that it didn't. Most surprising has been it's high speed performance. I travel often across the sparse and remote Alligator Alley. I have been known to open it up going across and holding speeds near 120 MPH. The S60 is smooth and confidence-inspiring at those speeds. Kudos to the Volvo engineers who designed it. Very well done. "

The cars handling is OK but I'd prefer more rode feel but it was acceptable. Acceleration was good.

However, I did notice some fit and finish problems in the interior after a few days of driving. I went back to the dealer to point these out and they took pictures and sent them to Volvo. I bought the car in Feb. 2012 and it is June and the problems have not been resolved.

219,S60,2013,4.1, 03/31/2016,Brian,T5 4dr Sedan (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6A),104 of 107 people found this review helpful,A solid workhorse in a field of sprinters,5,"Here's the deal, this car is a niche buy and tell you why. But first some background. My job is in the automotive electronics world, so working with car companies and design engineers is what I do 50 hours a week. What most engineers will tell you over dinner is that Volvo's have and do have the most solid design in the world. What that means is that they favor safety and long-term reliability over short-term aesthetics and performance. Here is where the problem begins. There are large segments of car buyers and this one fails to hit a big group. I'll get to that later. But here goes my personal review.

This is an awesome car, but I'll give my 3 small criticisms. 
1. The backseat. There are no 2 ways around this. The backseat is comfortable but insanely small. If you're over 5ft 8 inches, people will be uncomfortable sitting behind you. 
2. The instrument cluster/infotainment. The speedometer takes a little getting used to. I'd expect a digital one to be honest, but you don't get it here. Can't say why its off a little, but its a minor annoyance.
3. Front seats. This is really dependent on the person. I'm 6ft 5in, so I'm a big guy. This car has really nice, comfortable seats, but they sit low and the whole car has kind of a low profile. For the extra long trips, comfort is a bit of an issue. But this is really just a big person problem. My wife and brother in law have driven it long distances as normal sized people in great comfort.

Now the good. Where do I start. I have the AWD version and live in Minnesota, so you can do the math of how much fun you have when you mix a turbo with AWD in the snow. But that's not unique to this car. What is unique is the build itself. What you'll find when you drive european cars like this is that they just feel tight, from the suspension to the steering. But the S60 has an extra feeling of being just solid and that doesn't wear off. If you care to do so, just open the hood or go underneath it. I've done a little work myself and can tell you that they are meticulously well built and designed. There is a really rugged simplicity to them.  the car is sport, quick and responsive. Don't believe reviewers that tell you otherwise. Simply google the 0-60 and other tests, it performs well. 

This is where it begins to distance itself from the Audi's and BMWs. These Volvos are best bought by people that plan to own them for a while. the target market is someone who wants a nice European style sedan with Japanese reliability. I've only had to have on repair done and it was the electronic parking brake motor (under warranty). But I can tell you that the repair bills will be nowhere near that of its European cousins, but will be higher than an American or Japanese car. 

The bottom line is that no matter what you hear or are told by Audi fanboys and the like, the S60 is a better car if you care about long term reliability and affordability. You may get a little more short term spunk from the Audi and BMW counterparts, but the only other place you'll get more is the price tag and the repair bill. 

There has been a ton of market research on this point and there is a significant segment of the population that buys European cars in this price range. That segment is men, ages 25-40. The main reason they buy them is the name recognition and status. The problem for Volvo is that Audi, BMW and to some extent VW own this space almost completely. There are 2 companies trying to crack that market. Cadillac, with their ATS and Volvo with the S60. Both a failing for the most part. The reason is that they don't have 4 rings or a blue and white badge on the grill. 

Long review, but I feel this car deserves it. Don't fall victim to the popularity contest. In this class of cars, this is the smart person's choice. "

Normally I will buy a car, drive it for 30-40K miles, and go for something different.  This S60 has been different.  I just turned over 105K miles, the car still drives like the day I brought it home, and I can honestly see myself putting 200K on it.  Other than routine maintenance and gas, it has never cost me a penny or a day in the shop.  The strengths of this car for me are (1) Smooth power, linear torque, and good acceleration; (2) Strong, smooth brakes; (3) Understated, classy looks that have held up well vs. newer designs; (4) Rich leather that has aged incredibly well considering the hours I've spent in the driver's seat, along with a simple, uncluttered interior layout; (5) Great factory stereo that pairs flawlessly with multiple devices; (6) Spring loaded rear headrests that can be released from a button on the dash to unexpectedly smack smart-alecky kids in the head (a source of great amusement for the whole family).  If I could change anything, it would be:  (1) Transmission is not as smooth as some out there (my daughter's VW, for one).  It's always been just a little more twitchy; (2) Trunk space is OK, but awkward to get anything of any size in and out.  Putting back seats down doesn't help much.(3) Some of the silver trim on the center console is starting to flake/delaminate around the edges, and every once in a while a piece will get very sharp and has to be clipped off.  Bottom line though is that has simply been the finest vehicle I've ever owned. "

Sure it has 4 doors but the back seat is useless. The trunk isn't much better. At 12cu. ft. even a simple weekly trip to the grocery store requires items to be put in the back seat for the trip home. As for a road trip with more than 2 people just forget it. There is no way to put enough luggage in the trunk for anything more than a weekend and anything bigger than an infant in the back seat is a joke. Ironically, the only people that would fit in the back seat only make the lack of trunk space worse because they require even more stuff. Fuel economy on a vehicle of this size is awful. I owned a Accord before this vehicle and the mileage was on average 35% better for a vehicle that was bigger and older. The audio controls are confusing and lack simple functions. The Volvo system stores information some logical and some not so logical places. The resale value of this car has plummeted and I am not in a market where there are a number of these vehicles available so oversupply is not driving down the price. If we had not traded a paid in full vehicle against the purchase I would be upside down on the loan. We looked at other Volvo's to replace this one but found most suffer from the same lack of seating in the rear seats. If your going into this purchase thinking you are buying a sedan look elsewhere, if you wwant to pretend your buying a family car and really buying a sport coupe then this is a good vehicle for you.

With the kids finally grown, I wanted a nice sedan to replace it after my son wrecked it. Of course, after a wreck, you want something safe. This car was the perfect balance of luxury, ride, performance, and gas mileage, all on REGULAR gas! Other luxury performance cars are strictly Premium grade gas. And this car passed the newest type of crash test at the IIHS which Mercedes, Audi, BMW didn't pass at all. Acura barely passed. Do other cars get better performance specs? Sure, but they cost noticably more. BMW gets better mileage, but again at higher purchase price and premium gas.

Additionally, the turn radius is excellent, the city braking is a very useful back-up, and the interior is very comfortable. The dual climate zone works well, as do the auto climate and heated seats. The only downsides to the car in my experience have been the fuel economy (not great, but the price you pay for driving a small tank, safety-wise) and the Navigation system. Whatever software the navigation uses is terrible and frequently takes completely illogical routes. I just end up using my phone's navigation. Overall, I love the car. "

I decided to lease this time around. Long story short, I got a S60 T5 AWD with Premier and Sport packages.

I just picked up my S60 a few days ago after comparing quite a few cars. Audi A4, Buick Regal, Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Cadillac ATS, BMW 3 series & Mercedes new A class.
The Volvo was overall the best choice for me as an everyday car. It does all things well and represented a great car for the money. A bit more money than the fully loaded Ford, Buick and Honda but with better quality and features. The same feel and features of the Audi, Mercedes and Cadillac but without a higher price tag and the horrible excuse for a back seat. "

First, let me state that I have no need for any of the common bells and whistles that manufacturers have been adding to vehicles these days such as lane departure warnings, park assist, even navigation.  This review does not evaluate those areas because quite frankly I don't care about them or use them.  I'm motivated by the following:  how does the car drive, how does the car look, does the car meet my interior/storage needs and how reliable is the car?  That's it.  With that in mind, let's get started.  I narrowed the field down to the Audi S4, Lexus IS350 and the Volvo S60-T6 since all had similar performance specs like 300 HP and AWD as well as identical 0-60 times.   In terms of pure driving performance and sex appeal, the S4 and IS350 win without question.  I'd put the IS350 as the champ.  However, after many test drives I came to realize that 90-95% of the performance those cars offer can be found in the S60-T6 for only 70% of the price.  In other areas such as rear passenger area & trunk space, the S60 was the winner.  I've only owned this car for 30 days so I can't speak to the reliability yet, but I'm expecting industry-standard costs.  One of the things I've noticed is that it's not as smooth in Sport mode both in up/down shifting as the others, but in regular drive mode it's fine.  Aside from that, it's a joy to drive and at a fraction of the cost of it's peers.  And even though I didn't need a luxurious leather seat, it truly is like sinking into a Lay-Z-Boy recliner--amazing.  Bottom line: if you're looking for best in class regardless of price, look to Audi or Lexus and expect to pay $7k-$10k more.  If you want the best interior comfort & space, equal acceleration, 95% driving dynamics and 90% sex appeal for 70% of cost compared to rivals, the S60-T6 is the choice to make.  I've been incredibly happy with it. "

It is just an all-around competent vehicle that is a pleasure to get in and drive everyday. It has a super high quality feel - like it's built very solid, something I didn't get in my Accord or Camry Hybrid. I just love the leather interior in this car - it is thick, comfortable, and smells great. The performance is more than adequate with the 5 cyl T5, steering and handling are excellent, and the comfort on long road trips is great, even with two bikes on the roof. Reliability has been fine - just routine maintenance required, and one A/C component replaced under warranty. I couldn't be happier.

Update - still happy with my S60. I do sometimes wish I had the newer 4 cyl Drive-E, as it gets better mpg with the same performance, but everything else about this car is superb,  so I'll live with it. I get 24 mpg in mostly urban driving with 29-30 on highway trips. "

I have one major issue with this car.
 Volvo has built heating elements into the windshield (small wires every few millimeters).
At night all lights reflect off of these wires and makes the lights blurry.
It is a huge safety issue and is extremely annoying.
Due to this issue alone, I am not sure if I will keep this car very long.

Mine is Ice White - and I'm glad as I'm not a fan of the fancy metallic whites. My factory warranty included everything - including wear and tear items like windshield wipers and brake pads - which they kindly replaced at my request at 49,500 miles. I was treated like a king at every service appointment (Waukesha, WI dealer) and have not yet had one single reason to go in for any issue - scheduled maintenace is all I needed. My car has the 19"" Bor wheels running P7 Pirelli Cinturato's and they are indeed good for all-seasons - and I live in Wisconsin. My only mistake was blowing over $2,000 on a set of snow tires with BBS wheels I bought from The Tire Rack. Great service from the company but I used them the first year for about a thousand miles and just never had a need to put them back on for snow as the P7's work great with the all-wheel drive - the biggest issue I've had is driving through snow deep enough that the front end was lower than the snow on the road but it still plowed right through! Great car in snow. Random comments as they cross my mind while I type....The navigation system is by far the worst I've ever used - it's only when you know where you're at that you realize the stupid thing is taking you out of the way. It's brutal. I suppose if I'm driving to Florida it would get the three Interstates right but for all else - pull out your cell phone and use Google Maps or Waze. Very roomy front seat - plenty of elbow-shoulder-leg room. The back seat is a place you'll not want to be if you're an adult and you better hope you don't have Jimmy-legs because you'll end up pulling your hair out. If you need a back seat on a regular basis-look elsewhere. I drove a Ford pickup as my main vehicle for 25 years before this and I love how handy and easy to park this thing is. Performance is outstanding - I love-love-love the sound of that inline 6 turbo coming out those dual exhausts and with the tire-wheel setup it is an excellent handler. If you see one of these for sale with decent mileage - grab one unless you're a fan of whiny overworked 4's. All in all - I love this car. "

Sometimes  the roof liner rattles- the dealer couldn't find the problem.
The front tires wore unevenly at 20 k. I had the tires rotated (free) and paid $100 for a front end alignment because it was past the adjustment period.

I have had a s80, xc70 , xc90 or, and a 2012 s60 fwd which was faster and more fuel efficient but squirrelly when accelerating on turns/curves and less refined car overall than the 2014 s60.

Performance is not the same as a BMW, but neither is the price.  You might as well pass on the useless piece of electronic garbage they call a NAV system.  I came from an Infinity M35, and I might have only Volvo's from now on.  The car just feels very well put together.

90,000 mile update:  The lack of a spare tire has left me stranded a couple of times now.  Volvo service came and towed me each time, which was nice, but it can be a wait.  Maybe I should have paid the $300 for a $20 spare tire.  An inflation kit doesn't help when you've had a blowout.  Have had zero mechanical issues otherwise.

Update: The stock tires sold with the S60 get very noisy in the 2nd half of their life.  I've figured out the weirdness of the NAV.  It's still awkward, but I'll upgrade it to ""usable."" "

End 6/14 (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6A),38 of 39 people found this review helpful,"29 months in, very pleased but wish we got the V60",4,"S60 R design Platinum.   Zero issues over the past 2 years plus.  Mileage is 22.5mpg short trips mostly with a couple of highway trips a year, 28 mpg on expressway at 70mph,   Gas tank is maybe 17 gal so range is only about 450 miles w/o pushing your luck.  

Acceleration is as much as a sane person would every need.  Effortless and tons of torque is around way down low in the rev band.   Smooth engine that growls if you punch it but is otherwise quiet.   Throttle uptake is very touchy, unfortunately, taking a light foot to avoid lurching forward. 

Steering is precise but could use more road feel, though almost no cars have that any more.  AWD and 350 lb ft of torque are a great pairing, as you can floor it from a stop and turn into traffic with no fear of fishtailing, and it gives great confidence.  Minimal body roll, changed to almost none with the addition of an aftermarket tuner rear anti-sway bar.  I have since removed the aftermarket bar and sold it, finding it unnecessary.  Handling is confidence inspiring.  Reviews that talk of small differences between this and BMW are living in a fantasy land where people oversteer their cars around curves on public roads.   The G forces you feel in turns are more than enough to have you slow down before the grip of the tires is lost to understeer.   This is a sport sedan, not a sports car.  

Braking is not as quick as the XC60,  with the pedal having more play before it really bites.  Once you're used to the difference it's fine.  

Ride quality is firm but never harsh, noise levels are good on good roads, higher on bad ones.  But again, never uncomfortable.   Better ride and noise levels than our E90 BMW 3 series with 18"" wheels, I'd say.   We have the 19"" on this R design.   But this car will not please those looking for luxury quiet first and foremost.   On concrete expressways you get tire hum.

Trunk is pretty small,  rear seat room isn't an issue for us but it isn't big.  But we added 2 more dogs for a total of 4 so we wish we'd waited to find a V60 R design for the extra space in back. 

Insurance costs are low ($850/yr full coverage $500K liability) but we are middle aged.  

The upgraded Platinum level Stereo is surprisingly good for having no dedicated sub-woofer.  The Nav system is not very good at all.   Just use your phone or a Garmin.  It will send you on crazy turns on small roads and the interface is cumbersome.   The dash is great looking and the big digital speed readout really makes a HUD superfluous.   Climate control works fine, the interface for the entertainment system is not touch but works fine once you learn that the button on the wheel controls most things. (along with one on the panel your passenger can operate)

Comfort is great on long trips, the seats are the best I've had in a sedan.  They soften with time, btw. 

  Visibility is not great in blind spots.  I thought the BLIS was a waste of money, but it really comes in handy in heavy expressway traffic where long looks at your blind spot are not always safe.   I still check, but do so knowing my BLIS will back me up and alert if I try to signal a turn with someone there.   It also has the ability to ""See""   cars overtaking you and prevent you from getting in front of them if there isn't time for them to react.   It works very well and unobtrusively with a light most of the time, alerting only if you attempt to change lanes.  

The interior has held up well and I expect it to continue to.  Material quality really is superior, it's just that some people expect to see German or Japanese design and this has a Swedish mentality to it.   Basic, sparse, but high quality.  

Negatives would be that the transmission is a little lazy in regular mode.  Sport mode sure solves that, but at the expense of holding lower gears a little longer than you'd like in routine driving.  But for spirited driving, it's great.  Another issue would be that the bluetooth streaming will cut out for a second every now and then at first, then eventually settle down and work well.    The Nav is a disgrace, 

The 5 year warranty with full maintenance we got free during a summer promotion helps offset the biggest negative, the poor resale value.    We thought about trading ours for a V60 but found it was worth about $10,000 less than we paid for it after a year.   This will flatten out, but for some reason all Volvos seem to take a steep initial drop in value, and some, like the S60, keep dropping.     We paid about $6500 less than MSRP in 2014.

Overall, besides the BMW 328i, which will cost a little more and be a little less quick,  I wouldn't seriously consider another make for this specific class of car.  However, I do prefer slightly larger vehicles for the interior ""elbow room"".    The BMW will have a bigger back seat.    

And yes, Volvos are built like vaults.   Very solid.   Still loving it and we're hard to please. "

The 2015.5 platinum makes an already good car superb. It's simply fun to drive -- not as fun as my old Merc C230 coupe, but still pretty darn good for a sedan. Mileage in the first few months is about 33 hwy and 28-29 combined -- that should get better, indeed I hope it does with the touted drive-e engine (I was at 24 combined in my 2012 T5).

14 months later my combined mileage barely holds on to 29mpg -- that's equal to or less than many CUVs on the market now; one would think it'd be well over 30 in a small sedan. After being saved by the collision mitigation warning light and beep (almost rear ended someone), it's now something I ignore. It will go off when I'm driving in housing divisions and weaving around parked cars on the road. 

What I REALLY wish this car had was more tech, or easy tech. I want to be on my phone or desktop and EASILY send directions to a destination (because it takes FOREVER to do it in the car). You have to use a special app / website, then it doesn't always load in the car, and if it does, it will take many, many minutes. So, still a lot of updating to do there. 

I also wish with voice nav you could say ""Nearest Arby's"" or whatever, instead of being forced into ""Nearest restaurant"" and scrolling through the list forever; all that time when my eyes are not on the road. But hands down one of the BEST radar cruise control systems -- takes you all the way down to zero and has excellent distance (much farther than my wife's loaded Mazda 6).

Otherwise, great performance, love the turbo, awesome seats on my long trips, still looks good, not many others drive one (a shame!), and the value is superb for what you get. Absolutely a BMW and MERC alternative. "

In normal mode the car will accelerate off the line with the authority dictated by how hard you press your right foot down, but you can also drive quite leisurely.

I enjoy the way it performs, the speed, the handling, etc.  It's a bit tight (I'm 6'2"") but overall it's been a great buy.  My only issue has been on maintenance and I can't decide whether it's the vehicle or the dealership which I've been using for maintenance.  I've had three instances where ""major"" repairs have been required, the most recent of which is currently in the works and involves replacing spark plugs which should not need to be replaced after merely 18,500 miles.  I've already had one internal sensor replaced at the recommendation of VOLVO Central and it's likely that this current repair will require the replacement of a cylinder.  I've had this vehicle for less than two years, and it has ""granny"" miles (coming up on 18,500) yet somehow it's required days worth of repairs.  Recognizing that these repairs are all covered under the current warranty (thank God) it's still a bit of a disappointment because I enjoy this vehicle.  Once I get the vehicle back to health - from fuel economy to comfort, it's a great purchase. Just starting to wonder whether VOLVO sold me the proverbial ""lemon."" "

I also love confortable seats and these are truly amazing.  I love gadgets and technology and I feel this comes loaded, love the number pad.... I make many calls for work so I find it very practical, I was very annoyed by the start-stop engine system but you can disable it when you run the car on , which is great. I wanted the MB CLA but they did not give me a good deal so went with the dealer that sold me my VW and after looking at the cc and Eos wasn't convinced , they are great cars but the cc felt for older people and the Eos was again a 2 door car and was tired of having a 2 door car... it does look  bit like many new other cars out there pretty much every make has a model similar to the S60 but it is still a good looking sedan with nice clean lines.  The adjustable lumbar part of the front seats and heated seats are also a plus... I use it even in the summer in FL. I am not a fan of the dual AC ... it is kind of annoying. at least for me. I like that the cover for sunroof is totally sun proof unlike mercedes and vw which are not 100% sun proof and I can't stand feeling the sun on my head specially since I can't be under the sun. My daughters say the seats in the back are confortable, I like that you can (at the push of a button) tilt the hardest in the back seats to allow better visibility...

GOOD: Great styling (my opinion), excellent handling and brakes, excellent (Volvo!) safety ratings, very comfortable front seating, AWD is very sure-footed and even helps with powered turns on dry pavement.   Sound system is very good quality ('tho the antenna is not very good compared to most other cars).   Excellent interior materials.  Dealer support is excellent.    NOT SO GOOD: 5-cyl ""T5"" engine has decent power, especially at lower speeds where it is very torquey, but unimpressive at highway speeds.  Some noticeable wind noise, fair amount of odd or annoying noises from the many electronics.  Volvo GPS navigation is okay but slow, very slow, really sloooooooow, sometimes gives direction after you've passed the place to do it, and entering destinations can be VERY frustrating or even impossible, but does make good calls on traffic conditions.  
BAD:  [UPDATE: Traffic guidance expired, to get it back requires a complicated process of Internet subscription, traffic reports subscription, etc., all at extra monthly costs.  A $150 Garmin can have LIFETIME traffic and map updates, so I guess ""Swedish luxury"" is cheapo and not so good??]   No ""cubbies"", so no open or casual storage for driver stuff beyond the glove box and console box, both of which are okay but awkward to reach while driving.   The alleged ""city traffic"" automatic braking feature has never worked when tested (??).   NO SPARE TIRE INCLUDED; The standard gel tire repair system may serve for most punctures, but if a large puncture or tear, it's useless, and it can potentially ruin wheel balance and/or the TPMS sensor so add cost and trouble to your follow-up repair woes.  Adding a spare tire is in my opinion the right thing to do but it's not cheap and the trunk then goes from ""small but okay"" to almost useless.   So much for this being an expensive luxury car!    Things going in and out of the trunk will chip the rear bumper paint, no rubber bumper guard like on most other cars, even low-priced ones.     Rear seat room is honestly a cruel joke unless midgets are in the front seats so front seats are pulled all the way up to provide (sigh) minimal leg and foot room in back, and even then the roof downslope makes it claustrophobic.  There was and I think still is a ""stretched"" version of the S60 with more rear seat room that I think is the only way to buy an S60, significantly more expensive and still not great but at least acceptable and useable.   Trunk is okay if you do not add an (optional!!) spare tire, but not having a spare tire is, to me, foolish.  Update, end of 2019: The media/info screen system is tedious, unsafe to use while driving.  Buttons and dials must be looked at by the driver to tell one from the other, no tactile differentiation.  Still like the car but obviously the designers just looked at things on their CAD screens and never drove the car.  Okay but not a real driver's car.  Still fun to drive, still exceptionally safe if/when needed, solid, but so many unnecessary and unexpected annoyances, so flawed. "

The gas mileage is poor and has never met the 30-37 mpg it advertised. The start/stop function drains the battery. I have had the battery replaced 3 times in 4 years and $360/battery is not what I consider reliable. The car has been to the shop 8 times for problems. So far, I had to replace the fuel pressure sensor, thermostat, right engine mount, parking brake sensor (I don’t even use the parking brake) which was sticking and wearing my break pads, not to mention not safe, fuel pump, engine coils and spark plugs (under recall), and fuel compression regulator. I have spent $2,500 in just 3 weeks. My senors either go off for no reason or don’t alert me when they should have. I like the seats and stirring wheel which are comfortable. It LOOKS great.  The ride is rough and I hear a grinding noise when I drive, which Volvo cannot isolate the problem, nor do they care when I reported it. The battery they replaced was faulty and I had to cont BBB just to get them to replace it. Because it was replaced under warranty, they wouldn’t replace it out of warranty even though they replaced the bad battery with a faulty one. That is when I decided that I will never purchase another Volvo in my lifetime and I do not recommend this car. I’m going to a competitor with a reliable vehicle. Poor service, poor reliability, outrageous repair costs and the betrayal of my trust in a brand where they did not deliver. My loyalty with Volvo ended 12/12/18.

Beemers were trendy but cars like Saab and Volvo were something to aspire to. With one of those, you had quality and class. Right? Not anymore. Sadly, they've killed Saab. Ive now leased my Volvo just over 3 years and it's time to turn over the keys. There's nothing about this car I will miss. Not the random way the e-drive would kill the engine just as the light turned green (reminiscent really of learning to drive my first stick shift car and popping the clutch to a lurch and dead engine).

Or just for fun starts randomly beeping when you are certifiably in the middle of nowhere with no obstacles for 20 feet in any direction. I could go on but why. This car was a disappointment. My local dealer (the ONLY Volvo dealer in a metropolitan area of over 2 million!) Over promises and under delivers and features a service department who specialize in mansplaining. I especially loved the way I would schedule service with a confirmed loaner car for the day only to be told there were no S60s available that day. Fine, I said...  give me something else. You would have thought I'd asked for the shirt odd his back. Turns out they had a caste system for loaner cars. I drive a lowly S60 and an S60 is all the loaner car I'm entitled to. God forbid a lowly S60 owner sully the steering wheel of the XC90. After standing my ground and waiting for the snootysnark of a service advisor to go to the service manager I was allowed to drive a loaner car (THAT I HAD RESERVED) waaaay above my station in life.

Super safe, very smart, reliable, great breaking, very good on the road. The only reason i am on this web site is that i did not negotiate my lease well enough and my lease payoff is way too high to keep my car. But over all this is my third Volvo, the previous was s60 2012 and it drove slightly different (they change the wheel to electric one on 2015) also 2015 is way more safer. It will get you spoiled in terms of standard safety features. The ones i personally use the most are: BLIS (blind spot aid), cross traffic (it's when you are pulling out of your parking spot and dont see the approaching cars in the isle - the car spots them and if needed automatically applies breaks), citi traffic feature is very useful too - it applied breaks a couple of times when my car approached another car too close in slow to semi-slow moving traffic. The seats are ... can i get one like those for my living room please? I drove about 10 times from DC to NY and back and never felt tired sitting in the car. Breaks are super, the car stops on a spot! the road handling is very good too - i feel safe in a rain or snow. However you need to be careful when there is a lot of snow - back in Snowmageddon of 2016 I was driving home when there was already about 3 inches of fresh snow on a road and car was swaying from side to side just a little bit. Having said that, navigation is horrible - routinely would tel me to make an exit from the left last second when i am in the far right line, or to save my money would take me back streets instead of the paid highway (even though settings set to the shortest route) (and that's exactly why, by the way, i ended up driving in 3 inches of snow back in 2016), or you will have to use that rotating knob to enter the address for about 15 minutes and then the system would tell you ""no such street"" or offer you another building. You will be better off using apple maps. Ride is a bit on a stiff side, but what do you want from the very cute tank? And that's exactly how I think of my car - it is a very cute, very smart tank with lots of babble wrap inside to protect me.  I am currently shopping around.  Audi A4 looks very dull compared to my car (everybody said the ride is much better, I tried Q3 - and its not THAT much better). BMW 300 series and merc C300 both drive nicer, but way more pricier and not as safe. XC-60 is just like my car, I feel totally home in it - but brakes are slightly weaker and headlights are not as good too. I mean, its a very very nice car, I have hard time being completely swept away by other cars in the same class. Cons: navigation sucks, slightly stiff ride, and apparently volvos in general depreciate very fast and loose value, so if i will get a new volvo - i am driving it to the ground. From the consumer reports reviews i know that 2015 is probably was one of the worst quality wise years (nothing major, just small stupid things that drove people nuts - like oil lamp is on, nothing wrong with the car, but its still on, stuff like that) but my car so far hasn't given me a second of grief. Also I have one of the prettiest combinations of black paint with red shine in it and light leather inside - so pretty!  I am sure will be sad to part with my car! "

Getting to consider the Volvo was due primarily to the very positive experience we had with the dealer group (Fields Automotive) while we owned our 2005 Infiniti G35 sedan.  That was a great car, but we were not enthused about staying with Infiniti (great driving experience, but expensive operating and maintenance costs).  Same group had a Volvo store and decided to check it out.  First impressions: clean design, interior and exterior (typical Euro/Scandinavian functionalistic, without being cold);  good driving experience: totally surprised by throttle response from the T5 engine, handling; visibility, and  comfort. Also appreciated that the tech interface was not the centerpiece of the dashboard like most new cars.  Good combination of actual buttons and knobs with screen controls.  Has a screen saver option, so the display goes dark after 20 seconds, instead of staring at you.  Looked at an Acura TLX 2.0 4-cyl (poor engine response, dash is way too busy) and a Lexus ES (nice car, still a Camry, and pricey).   So we went with the S60 (thought about the V60, but didn't need the extra room, and the sedan was a bit quieter).
We've only had it 4 months, but still very pleased. Good on the highway: plenty of power even at speed, quiet: some road noise, but not obtrusive.  City driving is relaxed.  Auto Stop/Start is a little weird at first, but you get used to it.  BLIS is great.   Back seat (which has been described as tight) has been totally comfortable for 2 adults.  Trunk has also been adequate for our needs.  Great gas mileage: 25/35 (which is tremendous coming from about 16 mpg on a good day). 
Only issue was the electric defrost built into the windshield, which comes with the Climate package.  Was very distracting: Volvo replaced at N/C with standard windshield.

Update:  Have had for about a year now.  Still very pleased.  Tires showing some early wear, but that seems to be the norm for the factory installed Continentals.

I miss my turbo C30 which was much peppier and way better looking in my opinion, but it was time for a grown up car that was refined yet affordable. I would say this fits the bill nicely and in a few years I will spring for the V60 wagon or XC60 crossover, since I prefer them both to a sedan. I wish I could have got the adaptive cruise control, but I would have had to go up a trim level to platinum and didn’t want to spend the additional $5k for the cars that were available with this option. Too early to say much about reliability but I’m hoping for the best. Road noise is not bad and the ride is nice. Not to cushy and not too tight. The stereo sound sucks but the Bluetooth works seamlessly. The interior is attractive with good quality materials, although I’m not in love with the colors and displays directly above the steering wheel. I like floating center panel. This car definitely does not make me want to race anyone at the stoplights. It does make me look and feel like a responsible adult which was necessary for my line of work. I guess the fuel economy helps make up for the lack in go go juice. "

I loved that car and since it had been discontinued I thought the S60 AWD was a good choice. I love the car but hate the handling on older pavement. It tends to ride down the road like a train rocking back and forth and can be difficult to control without 2 hands firmly on the wheel. When I purchased the car I noticed it had been in the shop several times for tire issues, new tires and alignments within 10 or 15 thousand miles. I bought it with 31k at 36 months.  I had it aligned just a few weeks ago, after 7k miles since the last alignment, and the rear alignment was out. This helped but the car still does not handle the way I would expect. I own 2 other all wheel and one 4x4 which none handle this poorly. Not sure whats up or if this is just an issue with this car. Tires are Continental high end and have about 70 percent tread left. "

The awful part was I wasn't even due for my first oil change yet. Volvo has done nothing about this issue and the dealership did nothing except offered to put a used engine in for $5000.

I haven't purchased the newer version yet because I really am quite happy with this car.

3.  Seats.  Wow.  very comfortable seats.
Things I don't like:
1.  No spare tire.  Volvo the safest car in the world and yet if you get a flat, you are screwed. I purchased a full spare size tire and put in the trunk.  So my trunk space is scarce.
2.  Stiff ride.  Feels every bump I go over.  Not forgiving at all.  Thought Volvo is safe and comfortable car.

Volvo does front seats better than anyone in my opinion; these are sculpted and amazingly supportive in beechwood/black leather. The feel of the car is luxurious, tight, quiet and cocoon-like but it gives you a sense of being in touch with the road and very much in control. Consumer Reports recommends this car and says reliability is ""better than average."" This trim line comes with  an excellent Harmon Kardon stereo with 12 speakers, LOADS of safety features and electronics; my car insurance went DOWN 25% due to Volvo's safety record! 

The lighting throughout the cabin--which is very important to me--is really nice...with foot well lights front and back and lots of little ambient lighting touches throughout. The center console storage area feels small to me and is a little too vertical in comparison to my last car. The car feels welcoming and calming inside with its beautiful Scandinavian design cues and subtle luxury touches. This car has the extra 3"" wheelbase and therefore backseat room which is really nice. It feels sporty and nimble and can take corners quickly without a squeal but isn't a sports car per se. 

I shopped Audi A4, Lexus 250, BMW 328 and Volvo felt like the best overall choice for me in European sport sedans. (Most striking to me was that the current A4 was rated ""poor"" in one critical IIHS front collision test!) The Volvo trunk is spacious. This car comes with intelligent cruise control, backup camera, parallel parking assist, Volvo's BLIS system, keyless entry, fold-up outside mirrors, home link, navigation and mine has the 19"" alloy wheels with big Pirelli tires. I will check in again in six months and hopefully still be as happy then as I am now with my S60.

UPDATE: Six months in, I am still very glad I got my S60 Inscription! It is quick, nimble, very comfortable to drive in city & on the open road. The safety systems are superb & work exactly as designed! The radar-controlled smart cruise control amazes me every time I use it & the sensors front & rear and side-to-side make any parking pickle a breeze. And those industry-leading Volvo front seats do not disappoint. Awesome audio, too. 
The only small complaints I have are: some creaking in the interior on the rear right side of the cabin (although no squeaks or rattles of any kind) and I find that the wiper/washer/headlight washer system sprays excessive amounts of windshield spray which doesn't drain off the car properly & requires numerous wiper swipes to clear. All things considered, I would definitely buy Volvo again. "

I was looking for a car that is comfortable, safe, quiet, powerful enough yet with great fuel economy at the same time.  
I researched various cars like new Accord touring, Acura TLX, 2017 Audi A4, Bentz C300, Lexus IS350 and S60 Inscription. I narrowed it down to Volvo S60 inscription and Audi A4.  After test drive, the Volvo S60 Inscription stands out to be my top choice: it has the most head room for me and it is easily one of the smoothest to drive at all speed range. Standard features include leather interior, HD radio,  rear window sunshades, city safety and glass sun roof etc.
Exterior
The 18"" titanium wheels look handsome and provide very good ride quality. The tall roof line makes entering and existing the car extremely easy. The car looks small from outside while roomy inside.
Interior
High quality leather seats, simple yet elegant color combination is pleasant to my eyes. 
The sit position is more upright compared to other cars, together with excellent all-round support and wide adjustment range from the seat as well as from the steering wheel, easily provide the most comfortable experience among all the cars I've tested. The silk metal trim gives solid and luxuries feeling, the steering wheel has the perfect size, it feels really good in hands.
Driving
I own a Honda accord and my first impression driving the S60 is that the cabin is whisper quiet, much quieter than my Honda. The acceleration feels like a powerful V6,  the S60 feels very solid on road. It does not have much body roll when making turns, at the same time it filters uneven road surface nicely.
Safety features
Safety feature includes the ability to stabilize the car in case of a flat tire; also good space between the front bumper and the radiator that can reduce damage in case of low speed accident (There is a sticker on the rear window of the passenger side that indicates the car's rear and front bumpers are designed to withstand 3 miles/hour hit limit, which exceeds the standard 2.5 mile/hour limit, which result in no structure damage and minimum bumper damage that can be fixed easily ); the city safety triggered once when a biker cuts in front of my car when my car was moving slowly, nice!
Entertainment
I loaded all my music collections on to a USB stick and plugin to the USB port in center console. The album name, album photo and track names are displayed on the LCD screen. I can now enjoy the high quality music on my daily commute.
Overall the S60 inscription is an elegant car that meets all my requirements, it provides an extremely well balanced experience that makes the daily drive a true joy.
Update (11-19-2016):
The combined MPG is now 29.4 at 3316 miles, compared to 28.4 at 1800 miles, my daily commute includes mountain road with  a lot of up and downs. 
Started to use the front seat heating feature as it is pretty cold now in the morning. I can feel the heat in less than 10 seconds. I hope the steering wheel could also be heated. "

On the technology front, I simply don't want to drive anything else now (haven't driven my wife's Touareg in months - anytime we go out together, it's in the Volvo).  The adaptive cruise control has more than once alerted me to stopped traffic on I75 outside of Atlanta, and applied the brakes sooner than I would have by myself.  Combine the adaptive cruise with the blind spot detection, and it's like having a very competent copilot with me on every drive.  The cross-traffic alert is also very helpful - scans for people or moving vehicles as you are backing up and sounds an alert.  Ride comfort is a 10/10.  Incredibly comfortable leather seating and solid, quiet ride.  Reliability has been outstanding so far - I just passed the 20K mark with zero problems.  This is an outstanding car that I highly recommend.  I have owned a lot of vehicles including a 3 series, and none compare to this vehicle.

It was my plan to buy the car after the lease was up.  Everything was going well.  I serviced my car as required.  The problems began after two years in 2018.  My car began saying ""High engine temperature.  Turn engine off."" I took it to the dealership and they topped off the coolant.  Simple enough.  They didn't even write a ticket.  In early January, the same thing occurred. January 26th, the same thing the car continues to say the same thing.  They checked the blue tooth for proper contact.  February 8th, after bringing the car in again, the thermostat housing was replaced.  In February, same issue, the low fuel pressure sensor was replaced.  Towards the end of March, it began saying ""High engine temperature. Stop Safely"".  At this point, I was not allowed to accelerate the gas.  This occurred on the beltway in Washington, DC area in the midst of traffic! The water pump was replaced on April 9th.  At this point, I no longer wanted the car.  The last thing I want to happen is for the car to stop on me in the middle of the road/highway, risking my life, perhaps the lives of others in the car and/or countless others around me.  I expressed my concern to volvo and was told they could not replace the car or get me out of the contract.  On April 23rd, the car was brought in again and was fixed for the same problem.  I was told the car could be exchanged, but only if I took on a new lease.  My lease was up at the end of the year. The car was brought in again April 27th. After over two months on July 21st, the car was returned to me after being with the dealership for about a month.  It received a brand new engine.  On Friday, July 27th, the car was returned because it said, High engine temperature. Stop Safely"" and ""High Engine Temperature.  Turn off Engine"".  (Remember the car always says this) At this time, the engine wouldn't let me go over 17 mph in the middle of DC traffic.  Although three months of my lease was returned from the Volvo company. (they initially only wanted to give me one or two), all I want is to feel and be safe driving a car from one location to the next.  This is not what I feel in my Volvo, nor is it something that Volvo (the company or the dealership) is willing to give me.  Volvo, the car company supposedly known for safety, is not keeping me safe.  They continue to put me in the same car. "

HORRIBLE. the kind that makes you turn onto wrong ways, sends you on hour long detours... Nothing lasts on this car. Seats are falling apart, wiper blades don't do a good job. The plugs stopped working (to charge phones) Tires keep leaking air, we spend too much time at the dealership, just to be told the light alert is defective and they left the car as is with the tire sensor issue on... so many issues for a new car that we dont use much.

Was time for us to buy a sedan and move on from the mini vans and suv's. I had been wanting a Volvo for some time. Went to test drive a used T5 with open mind to other options, if price was right. Wound up comparing the 5 cylinder, AWD (used) to the 4 cylinder Front WD (new). Both cars felt very similar in handling, pick up etc. The better gas milage of the new, 4 cylinder won us over. Got a great deal at our local dealership. Super thrilled with our purchase. A couple minor disappointments. No standard back up camera. We were very used to this option and are considering putting one in. Trunk space is quite an adjustment. Half of a decent grocery trip winds up in the back seat. Other than that, I am a happy girl!!

Since I had just bought it, I called the used car dealer (not a Volvo dealer) & because he was over 2 hrs away, he told me to take it to a garage & have it checked out. The local foreign car shop told me the water pump was bad & that I needed a new engine. I was devastated, cause I really liked the car. When I called the dealer I bought it from, he said that can't be possible & asked me to take it to a Volvo dealer. I made an appt & went in & waited while they checked out the car. The mechanic came out & to my relieve told me that I didn't need a new engine. The problem was that the coolant is under a vacuum system & someone must have broke the vacuum & an air bubble was created in the coolant system, which caused the coolant not to flow freely. So he withdrew the coolant & put it back in under pressure to create a vacuum. He also said the coolant was a half a gallon short, so he knew that whoever had filled it last had not done it correctly. It's only been a couple weeks, but no more messages about the coolant being low or the car over heating. The dealer I bought it from was happy to pay for both diagnosis. I won't be bringing my car to the local foreign car garage, because he right out lied to me. He said he could see the coolant leaking out of the head gasket. I found that hard to believe cause it is parked in my garage and I couldn't see or smell any coolant. I'm glad I took it to the Volvo dealer near me and they knew what the problem was!!  "

I was beyond excited to get my first Volvo my excitement than turned into anger. I have owned this car for one year and purchased it with only 7000miles on the vehicle at time of purchase. Owned the car for approximately 2 months and when I was at a stop light the auto start feature was activated. I went to accelerate at a stop light and the vehicle would not move. It was in drive acting like it was in park. Took it into the dealership and of course couldn’t find anything wrong but decided to do a update on the transmission. This same issue continues to happen over the next year taken it to the dealership only to find of course no issues because there was no check engine light to be found to diagnose a error. While waiting in a drive thru lane this happened as well to my husband. He was stuck! He floored the car and the engine is on but the vehicle will not move until you put it in park and hit it off and turn it on again. Safety is not here! I unfortunately drive a lot for my work and will be getting rid of my car shortly. 

Beyond these issues, I too have had my tires spontaneously explode while driving 3 times with less than 15,000 miles on the car. I have had issues with the Bluetooth connection while on calls no one being able to hear me. Radio cutting out and screen going black. Error code for wind screen system.  This car is beyond loud at an idle. 

Done with this car and probably Volvo! "

We were looking for a car for long trips up to Canada that is both comfortable and fuel efficient.  I looked at Lexus, Audi and VW cars (we had a Honda, and had a bad reliability experience with the Mercedes E320 wagon).   The Audi is more quiet, but has a smaller interior with a smaller fuel tank - for long trips we really appreciated both the larger cabin, and the good fuel mileage.  We recently did 1000 miles up to Canada and back and can testify that the car performed very well.  Our son was comfortable in the back reading - in the Honda he got motion sickness.   In particular, while some journalists do not like the adaptive cruse control, I found it fantastic - once one gets use to using it, it makes long drives on moderately busy freeways much much more enjoyable and stress free.  The S60L has a longer wheel base which reduce handling, but increases stability - the car performed perfectly on busy highways with large trucks that can blow a car around.  Many journalists complained about the lack of a touch screen - I strictly preferred the S60 to both the S90 and Audi A4- the navigation screen is perfect - I find the heads up display very distracting, and once one gets the hang of it, the S60 system is efficient - the hardest thing to do is enter an address, but with Volvo on call this is easy - find the address on ones phone and then send to the car. The negatives are the following - small trunk - holds about 4 roll-ons plus a bit  - we got the spare tire that reduces trunk space (which for long trips is something we value - being stuck on a highway with a flat at 2am is not great).  Second, one can put a Class 2 hitch for a bike rack or cargo carrier, but for the moment there are no roof racks for the Inscription - Rhino Rack says they may do them in the future, but Thule (and hence Volvo) says they will not do them - so I would not recommend the car for a family that needs more space - with roof racks and a cargo box, the car could be a good family car - large cabin plus comfortable, but precise ride.  Finally, the car can use regular gas, but 89 octane gets 12% better mileage, so we will use that going forward. Overall, we would get the same car again, unless there is a V60 Inscription, which would solve the lack of cargo space, while giving more cabin space.

Update August 2018:  Our initial impressions have not changed much.  The following seemingly small issues would probably lead me to buy a different car this time:
1. Headlights are not great - it would be nice to have running lamps - I have these on my other car and have found that they do improve driving in the fog and snow.  Volvo used to have these, but no longer.
2. We did use the spare on the way to the airport and so it saved us from missing a flight - wish they would make more room for a spare.  
3. Still no rack for the car.  Really irritating, especially if  one skis.   I put a hitch on for a bike rack that I do us frequently, and had a wiring harness put in for towing - Volvo does not support these, so it was after market.  
4. Windshield wipers are not very good, and given the unusual specs I could not find an aftermarket pair that would do better.

Overall, it is a nice car, but for the American market Volvo really seems to want to force people to large gas guzzler's for car's that have utility features .  A sedan is great for day to day driving, and the extra room in the back is very nice.  However, for holidays one would like more usability features - overhead rack, better wipers, better lights.  In the theory the cross-country is suppose to cover these, but then why the small back seat? The longer Inscription is a definite improvement. "

I test drove several vehicles and ended up falling love with the Volvo due to it's classy interior and spacious back seat. While not a sports car it drives and handles well, and does everything I ask of it. These are the most comfortable seats I've ever sat in. They make it a pleasure driving this car. I am not crazy about the keyboard on the console, and I wish the dash was leather, but overall I am quite pleased. The trunk is a little small, but I also realize the spaciousness of the back seat is the plus here. I do like al of the safety features, and love having a back up camera and blindside sensors. I also like the wet sensor windshield wipers. I like the technology of the car. I think it has an adequate sound system, and the computer is easy to use once you become accustomed to it. My only qualm is the navigation system. It isn't easy to use, and you can't do a split screen of that and the radio. I have had no issues with the car thus far (6 months in) and the fuel economy is even better than advertised. "

I currently own a 2017 S60 Inscription model.  I did not realize that Inscriptions are made in China, not Sweden. My first drive on the highway revealed an air-leak noise when the car gets to about 60 MPH.  The dealer has attempted to fix this problem without success.  We drove another Inscription model vehicle; same noise.  The wind noise is very loud, so this is not a minor issue.  The dealer discussed problem with Volvo in an attempt to get me out of this vehicle and into a different car (Dynamic model).  Volvo refused to do anything, claiming that the noise is a ""characteristic"" of the vehicle.  Ridiculous response, as this noise should not be found in a $40K+ vehicle.  I have about 4,000 miles on the car and I am looking to get rid of it.  Anyone thinking of buying an S60 Inscription model should drive it on a highway getting to at least 60 MPH.  Not a normal part of a test drive, but advisable for the Inscription.  You will likely buy a different car.  I wish I had.   I now have about 23,000 miles on the car, and the ""wind"" noise and rattle under dash are still my driving companions.  Volvo has done nothing to fix either problem.  I am currently looking to trade the car.  I'll take a loss, but life's too short to drive this Volvo. "

I was only considering a sedan as my wife already had an SUV.  We were initially looking at the obvious German choices, but I was not a fan of the interior's and somehow we ended up at a Volvo dealer and when I sat in the car it literally felt like it fit like a glove.  The seats are amazing, the interior had a beautiful cockpit design for the driver and it was visually a beautiful interior.  While it is not a sports car, it drives very well, great acceleration, tight turning radius, it is both fun and pleasurable to drive.  Initially I thought the small trunk would be an issue, but as it turns out my family of 3 can put everything we need for a long ski weekend in the car with room to spare.  I did end up purchasing a few accessories, we added the factory roof rack for our skis, it fits perfect, no modification needed, added the glasses holder, the factory all weather floor mats and such.   What really surprised me was how comfortable the car is on long drives and how fuel efficient it was.  The stereo sounds fantastic.  On the flip side, it is a stiffer ride quality than I was expecting on local roads and the navigation is a little cumbersome, outside of that we love the car. "

This was my fourth Volvo.  All of the ads on this feature made me wonder how I or my family could drive without it.  A month after purchase, a man slammed on his brakes in front of me when a child went into the crosswalk (not dissimilar to the TV commercial).  My car not only didn't stop but didn't even slow down and rear ended the vehicle in front of me.  How could this happen when I had City Safety?  I sent a letter to the President of Volvo and was routed to customer service.  They sent a technician to check the ""black box"" and let me know the system worked just fine.  Read the fine print in the owners manual, they told me.  City Safety really only works in certain condition and the advertising is not accurate.  In other words, they mistake is yours.  You trusted us.  Volvo makes a just fine vehicle -- but this feature does not work.  #VolvoSafetyFail "

I took out about 10 makes from Audi to Honda to Mercedes etc. to find a comfortable ride. Taking out the Volvo S60Dynamic AWD was a revelation. Not only did the pain not materialize, but the seat and drive was very comfortable as well as engaging on a country road. The interior and exterior were attractive and its low key demeanor doesn't scream for attention. During the past 33 months, I've learned many interesting things about the vehicle. On a summer road trip to NJ in traffic the Volvo averaged 36-40 mpg @ 50-60 mph. The adaptive HID headlights are excellent for an older driver on a country road at night, where night vision isn't what it used to be. It is an excellent ski companion for a couple with AWD on snow covered roads with its ski tunnel and enough space for luggage and gear. The clincher was 2 weeks ago, when driving a back road after dark when tired, my concentration wandered and I had to emergency brake when the car in front of me stopped to turn w/o signalling. The car went into City Safe and stopped 2 feet from the back bumper. I thought it was a rear ender for sure. That was the clincher. I've decided to buy the Volvo and name her Inga. "

The ride, handling, and steering all strike a nice balance between comfort and sportiness.  I have had no reliability issues to speak of, and my overall MPG for the life of the car, based on the in-car computer, is 33 MPG combined.  Very impressive.  Contrary to an earlier review, this car is extremely quiet at highway speeds, no wind noise.  The standard sound system is very good.  One thing I appreciate about this car, especially in light of most new cars,  is that it has actual buttons and knobs for all major functions such as the radio and climate controls.  I am not going to lease another S60 because I find the touchscreen system too distracting.  The only real criticism I have of this car is the lack of storage.  You get two cupholders and that is pretty much it.  Nowhere for a phone, wallet, keys, etc, other than those two cupholders.  Overall, a very well-balanced, premium car that is comfortable and fun to drive, delivers well above average fuel economy, and has a timeless, classy design.  Not too bad.  "

Navigation does not seem to update traffic or construction. Dual-zone climate controls have no sync option. Exterior door handles are pinchy (watch your fingers or you'll be sorry).  The AT&T Wi-if is almost useless and difficult to setup with very, very slow speeds.  The menu system is NOT intuitive and to make matters worse, the manual is not applicable to the actual options in the menu system (e.g. There is no ""My car"" category in the menu system, which is frequently referenced in the manual).  The visors are not extendible so you have no way to block sunlight coming through the side windows (heck, even cheap Fords offer this).  The tire pressure system only tells you if you have a low tire.  No specific info as to which tire is the problem or how low it is.  No PSI display for the tires (again, even very modest vehicles offer this feature) however it does for some reason have a ""calibration"" process for the tires.

Lastly, Volvo has really emphasized customer focused experiences and the Service staff is terrific. I am a very impressed by Volvo! "

Starting off with the fact that it is the only ""luxury sedan"" where you do not need to put premium gasoline in it. The seats are incredibly comfortable and I actually do have a lot of back problems and commute about 50-60 miles a day. The cabin is incredibly quiet and even the T5 has great acceleration. The trunk space is adequate however I do wish there was a tiny bit more room in the back. Materials on the interior are high quality and the car has no squeaks or rattles. I love the Volvo on call service I get and the app that controls it. Gas mileage is great and the car in general is an overall great car. The reliability of it is definitely better than my BMW I had and the Volvo is by far the most comfortable car I've owned. "

My first S60 I owned and sold it in 2015 because my wife insisted on me driving a car with all the safety improvements. This brings me to one of the very few problems with the S60 and that is resale value. Like so many other cars nowadays my near perfect car with normal mileage was worth less than 50% on a trade. However the up to date safety features prevented me from two serious accidents so it was worth it. The car drives great. The comfort, quality feel, gas mileage and all the features work great. The only reason I ever go back to my dealer is for recommended maintenance. What I like about the S60 is I never feel bored driving it. I recently leased an end of year 2017 because the incentives to turn my 2015 in early were so sensational it made sense to do it. For the first time I got the Inscription model with the platinum trim. The extra legroom in the rear seat answered another issue with my two previous S60s. This is the best version I have had yet. The car now comes with an automatic shade for the rear window and manual shades for the two rear passengers. These are great to keep the kids cooler. This is a very good car. "

Being a baby-boomer having driven for many years I originally felt the safety technology would be an unnecessary distraction and possibly an outright annoyance, but having driven the vehicle only 2,600 miles I'm sold on it. The blind-spot and cross-traffic alerts are unobtrusive and the auto-brake tends to be in-sync with my own braking habits. The few times the auto-brake has engaged have been within a fraction of a second before applying the brake myself. The interior materials are high quality and the fit-and-form are excellent. Little extras such as the entry/exit lighting and theater lighting while driving are nice touches that add to the luxury feel of the vehicle, as do the soft-touch premium leather seats. For audio buffs (as I am), the Harman-Kardon audio system is fantastic. While acceleration is strong and smooth when getting heavy on the accelerator the 8-speed transmission is a little disappointing on the lower end of the RPM scale. Under modest acceleration the transmission shifts prematurely (in my opinion) and gives the impression of ""lugging"" the engine. Accelerating somewhat strongly to avoid the feel of ""lugging"" the engine has thus far produced an average city/highway MPG of 31.4, which is all-the-more impressive being a ""green"" engine. The 19-inch diamond-cut wheels look great and provide excellent handling with little additional road noise but do enhance the impact of bumps and rough road surfaces, a price I was willing to pay for the great handling. Overall I would highly recommend the S60. Feature-for-feature and dollar-for-dollar the S60 is a wise and enjoyable alternative to a pricier Mercedes, BMW, or Audi. "

The extra length loses about 10% of the sportiness of the shorter versions, but the solid value of understated elegance is quite apparent.

",2,"I purchased a 2019 Volvo S60 brand new and it has already been in the shop twice for multiple days (I had actually previously scheduled what would have been a 3rd appointment but ended up missing it). From the day I bought it, the media console was a bit glitchy. However, the first time I took it in was when the car died as I was switching lanes causing a ""service needed"" light to turn on. I took it in to Volvo, they had it for 2-3 days and told me that there was a computer system glitch where multiple signals went to the fuel tank at the same time, causing the car to die. They said they reset my computer system and that it would take care of 90% of problems (the other 10% was the rear suspension recall, which they fixed without prompting while it was there). I asked if they could guarantee the car wouldn't die again because it was a safety issue, and they said 98% guarantee. When I got the car back, I was still having issues with media console...mainly Apple CarPlay text features and radio volume issues so nothing major but still annoying. I scheduled an appointment, but ended up missing it, then a few days after, my check engine light came on. This is about a month (or less) after the car was in the shop the first time, and the vehicle currently has less than 4,000 miles on it. I haven't gotten the car back yet, but they said it will be in the shop for a minimum of 2 days and told me at the desk that it is likely a computer issue, again. The other bummer to me is that Volvo does not give Apples to Apples loaners like BMW (the other brand of luxury car I have experience with). They give you a voucher for Hertz (for which you have to pay a deposit). Last time, I was able to rent a Cadillac. This time, they put me in the crappiest, least equipped Toyota Corolla. 

I am so beyond frustrated and disappointed. My dad actually recommended Volvo to me and I really loved the car. I test drove BMWs and Audis before getting in this car, and I was just sold immediately after my test drive of this vehicle. The interior is just okay, but I love the look of this version of S60, I love the drive, I love the safety features, I love that it has just has enough power (I didn't want a sports engine but I wanted something with pick-up), it's comfortable, and I love the tech (when it works). Gas mileage is just okay and the trunk space is actually terrible (which would've been the biggest negative about the car), but overall, I was so thrilled with this vehicle that I was on board to be a Volvo enthusiast and my only ""regret"" prior to now was that I opted for the sedan over the SUV. I have now talked to multiple late-model Volvo owners (XC90's) who have both had to have their car replaced in the past and I keep getting told by sales that ""well this version of the car is brand new"" and ""any car can have computer issues"" as if that's an excuse. I've also read accounts of similar issues on forums pertaining to S60's from like 2016 on. I no longer have faith in this car brand and am just extremely disillusioned by this experience.  "

So many features come as standard equipment that are only available as upgrades in its competitors (BMW 3 series, Audi A4, AR Giulia, MB C-class), like for example paddle shifters and blind spot monitoring. And the premium package includes equipment that would cost much more in the other brands.  

My wife and I traded in our 2017 S60 Inscription for this new R-Design, and this is her daily driver, so we can make a fair comparison to the prior model, which we think is a wonderful automobile.  What we notice first about the 2019 model is that Volvo listened to its owners and responded with greater attention to details, like for instance the seat memory buttons.  In the 2016, you would have to hold the memory button down while the seat moved to its position (yes, I know, a tedious First-World problem).  In the 2019, one press of the button and the seat re-positions (along with the mirrors), letting you do other stuff to get ready and going.  The stereo system (600 watts Harmon-Kardon with 14 speakers) is vastly improved and can stand up to just about any other sound system in the segment.  The leather seats and the bolstering are incredible and having nappa leather seating hands down is so much nicer than having the chemical odor of faux leather so pervasive in the BMW 3 and Mercedes C classes.  The T5 power plant is superb.  With butter smooth shifting, almost no turbo lag, and more than enough horses and torque to get up and go, the punchy response and acceleration will please most around town drivers--and the car MOVES gracefully on the highway. The S60 is not large, but feels solid and connected to the road at low and high speeds.  Comfort and interior styling get an A+.  A tall adult will fit fine in the back seat, having far more leg room than in the BMW 3 series and far more headroom than the MB CLA. The standard panorama sunroof is also a nice feature you won't find as standard equipment in the competition.  Even though some criticism has been raised about the large touch screen control interface, it is not an burdensome learning curve to become adept at interacting with the car.  Having both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also new standard features we really missed in the 2017 model.  We do not find the steering to be lackluster or detached from the road at all (as some critics have said), the car is whisper quiet, the suspension and 18 inch wheels soak up urban highways without an issues (also contrary to some reviews), and driver visibility and driving confidence are superb.  

If you are looking for a compact luxury ride (although it is hard to imagine the S60 as compact), we encourage you to put the S60 on your test drive list.  It is uniquely Volvo, like nothing else on the road, a driver's car while at the same time an executive's show horse.  Volvo has definitely arrived in the small luxury sedan line-up with a car that meets and exceeds the competition in so many ways.  This is a car that lets you run in the pack without running with the pack. "

The 2019 S60 T6 is built on the SPA platform with awd and the car has some serious vibration problems.  It is well documented online in Volvo forums, I am not sure if the T5 fwd suffers from the same issues.  On the T6 awd at about 75 mph the car vibrates and the ride is unpleasant, my work truck rides better than this car. Volvo has tried addressing the problem by balancing tires and replacing rims but the ride in this 45k automobile is unacceptable. There is also a Technical service bulletin about the Vibrations but from what I hear it does not correct the issue.
If you search online there are a lot of complaints on new Volvo SPA platform with vibration issues especially the awd vehicles.

If there is one thing I will nitpick about the S60 is that the  button to start the car isn’t a button. In fact, it’s a knob that you turn to the right to start and stop the engine. I wish they would’ve stuck to a push button on the dash, but I’m just nitpicking at this point. One other thing, a few buttons for the climate control would’ve been nice, but whatever. The point is that the car glides and feels great on the road. When you need the power it is there and comes on quickly and smoothly. The car won’t push you back on your seat, but it gets up there rather quickly. Before this car I would lease a car and still think about my 2008 Infiniti G35 and reminisce on the good times I’ve had with it on the road. However, the S60 is now the car that has replaced that void I’ve had for my G35. I will always remember the good times with the greatest infiniti product made, but the Volvo S60 is the one I look forward to having fun with on the road, it is a wonderful machine and is the best in its class in my humble opinion.

The steering is pretty numb, almost like you’re driving something at Dave and Busters. The ride is really nice though and that’s on 19s.

",1,"Was very excited about my S60. Before I share my routine ownership experience let me just tell you that my car is a lemon. It drinks gasoline as if it was a v16 Lamborghini. 15MPG city / 19MPG highway is not near acceptable. I have filled up 7’tankanin the past 1300 miles. This is NOT OK and Volvo is not responsive to my emails and calls after opening a complaint. Moreover they tried to blame my driving which is really adding insult to injury . I have been driving for 30 years and had far better fuel economy on some huge engine gas guzzlers. I use Eco Drive and Comfort modes, drive mostly alone without load, on normal roads, in a flat area, at average weather/humidity and near sea level elevation. I’m not an aggressive driver. Moreover, this is a T5 FWD and I drove an AWD T6 loaner for a few days being aggressive on dynamic mode, I couldn’t get it to take more than 22.4
MPG/City. Speaking to other 2019
S60 drivers confirms my car is off. I deserve better than being ignored. 
So now, review after 2 months ownership:
The S60 is stunning inside out, great seats too, lots of technology-actually too much half-baked technology. The ride is comfort is average but a bit noisier than I would imagine. The ride is a bit lazy, the car is heavy and does not accelerate anywhere near its prescribed specs. It is annoyingly wide but this may reduce the roll. Assembly quality is a bit sloppy and there are some materials that seem very cheap. Vinyl seating (didn’t opt for Napa
leather) is not perforated and gets scorching hot in the summer and very sweat provoking. It’s a bit disappointing as the seats have such superior support. The Sensus system is frankly annoying. Volvo is selling itself as the safety company but there is nothing safe about futzing with screen drama for every little thing. It takes about 12 clicks to switch to your favorite radio station and even changing the AC fan speed requires far too many clicks and focal attention. There is no tactile sense to anything so you really have to be a distracted driver or stop on the side of the road. I don’t know who these days buys Volvo navigation when Google/Waze are years ahead and are free but if you don’t buy Volvo’s navigation, expect 1/4 of your big screen to become a permanent announcement of your lack of service. Additionally, while excessive features like touchscreen-activated folding rear headrests are standard, simple fog lights are a huge add on. Safety first? I don’t think so. Also the car is glitchy with CarPlay, windows that open on their own in the middle of the night, false airbags alert (recall completed
For that), false alerts from the OnCall app that my light bulbs need changing and that my trunk is open. This is a gorgeously designed over-engineered half-baked machine or disappointing quality. Its safety flaws are hidden in its user experience. And the worst part about it is that Volvo couldn’t care less. "

This is the crappiest luxury car ever. 

Good engine and drivetrain. Pretty fast pickup from stop, and that is all the good stuff.

Worst ergonomics, the driveshaft tunnel is way too high, no storage space other than two cup holders and are rear console/storage bin. 

Extremely frustrating touchscreen menus, not sure why Volvo went with tall touchscreen. Small width limits Apple CarPlay screen, and it is the smaller I have ever seen in modern cars. 

Worst yet, this is 2019 and this car has only one USB, just 1 in a freaking $50k car. Completely unacceptable.

Seating position is not good either, I don’t like to sit all the way down, And usually raise the seat few inches. After raising the seat, I started hitting my head while entering or exiting the car and my hair were running on the roof liner. I am 5’10” so it was disappointing to experience lack of headroom.

Poor visibility is another problem. Rearview mirror, front camera and passenger side A-pillar blocks 75-80% visibility on passenger side. This is very dangerous in urban environment while turning right when pedestrians might enter the intersection without warning.

Trunk space is limited. I was only able to fit two large size (28”) suitcases in the trunk. Absolutely no space left for anything else. With 2 adults and 3 kids, we had to be creative in packing for a 7 day, 2500 mile family trip. Very frustrating.

Half way in the trip, the lower engine cover fell dow and started rubbing in the road. Had to stop at closest Walmart and fix it using zip ties.

2 days later the Rear Left window trim piece came out and fell on the driveway while my daughter was raising the window :(

These are the things we experienced in 2 weeks. I am sure if we keep it longer we will find more stuff relating to poor workmanship, design and ergonomic.

I used to own a Volvo 960. The transmission went on it one day and the quote was $3500 to fix it. I sold after putting in a reconditioned transmission for $2200.

I thought Volvo quality might have improved in last 20 years, apparently not. 

Needless to say, I will not be buying/leasing or recommending any Volvo ever. Not worth the headache, frustration and my money. "

I’ve had BMWs and Audi’s before but like the Volvo driving, transmission, and safety.  I purchased a white t5 momentum with the premium package and heated seats and the blonde leatherette interior.  It drives much nicer than my 2013 s60 and much more rear leg room.  Overall it feels like a bigger smoother version. 

Here’s my buying advice.  

Blond leatherette feels and looks Exactly like the leather model.  I mean I had two two cars sitting side-by-side and was feeling both materials and couldn’t tell the difference. That being said, Black leatherette definitely looks and feels different.  If your thinking blond go with leatherette. 

YOU CAN ADD THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL AFTER THE FACT.   No one ever mentioned this until one person who did the ordering at the dealership did. It was a must have for me, so it restricted my search quite a bit.  But, for a couple of grand you can add it on and it saves you from having to buy the multi media and advanced driving packages saving you a few thousand.  HUD is a novelty.  Navigation isn’t needed since Apple CarPlay works seamlessly and Google map on the display works even better than the purchased nav.  

I found the actually T5 drove better than the T6.  I found it was smoother and quieter but still had plenty of power.   Would like the 4 wheel drive but I’ve had fwd Volvo’s in the snow in the past and they were fine.

Although not as powerful as my former S6, it's pretty close. What I lost in power and/or performance, I made up in fuel economy. I really like that I can operate this vehicle in pure electric, hybrid or full performance mode. 

Pros: 
Hybrid and full performance modes are quite exhilerating. 
Range / Fuel Economy - Managed to drive 800+ miles on one tank of fuel so far!
Very Strong Acceleration
Infotainment Sys (Once You Learn It)
Bowers and Wilkins Audio - Awesome!
Exterior - Not to Wild

Cons:
Pure Electric Range - 25 Miles Tops! 
Ride Comfort Dynamics - A Little Rough for a Luxery Sedan "

The interior and exterior style is one of the best in its class; the Audi A6 feels uninspired, the BMW 5 series is just basic, only the Mercedes E class might be able to hold a candle to the S90. 

Here’s what I love about the car:
1.	Design is absolutely incredible. 
2.	B&W sound system is incredible!
3.	iPad-like infotainment system is intuitive and awesome
4.	Safety systems. I can never go back. The Auto-pilot, adaptive cruise, lane keep, collision detection all work as advertised and are amazing.
5.	Heads up display (HUD) is a cool trick! I thought it was gimmicky but now love it.
6.	AWD performance in rain is incredible. On snow… not so much, but I blame the tires not the car.
7.	Heated/cooled seats 
8.	The diving profiles really change the characteristics of the car.
9.	Ability to send the car destinations


My issues with the car: 
1.	Fit and finish. The car has excessive squeaks, rattles, and road noise for a car with this price tag. I was caught up in the moment when during the test drive, but now after a couple of months, I need to drive with the music playing in order to enjoy the car and drown out the squeaks coming from the door seals and plastic bits. The road noise is also incredibly intrusive on Oregon/Washington pot-hole and crack-laden roads and highways. The luxury feel is compromised by the noise which is really unfortunate. 
2.	My second issue is with the front seats. The seats use a wire springs to support the driver. Unfortunately there are also some hard metal support beams that provide structure and rigidity to the thigh and leg support portions of the seat. Under the weight of the driver, these support 'beams' dig into your leg and thigh. No amount of adjusting will prevent this. Volvo should have used higher density foam or a full metal support under the seat to prevent the driver’s weight from compressing the foam and causing the support to dig into the drivers legs. Again, I must have been caught up in the moment of the test drive, because I didn't notice this until after I took the car home. So I'm relegated to using a donuts or foam cushion for long-hauls. 
3.	Opportunity number three. The infotainment system is ever so slightly under powered. It takes a lot of time for it to boot up. Thankfully the instrument cluster starts up right away. 
4.	Four, certain items need to be turned off every driving session. For example, the auto high beams, the auto start/stop, or my preferred driver setting -- I need to turn these on/off every time I start the car. Other manufactures got this right. For example, BMW let customers change the default setting for auto start/stop to remember the last selected setting. I WISH Volvo would do that.
5.	A/C has a tendency to kick into high gear randomly and it becomes really loud. You’re forced to turn it off if you are on a call. I think the problem is with the logic for the auto climate particularly when you have the 2nd row turned on. It’s as if the system was trying to compensate for the temperature differential and just… overcompensates.
6.	General reliability: Since taking ownership in February, I’ve gone to the dealership 4 times (I’m writing this review in April). Issues ranging from recall notices (for leaking A/C lines and trim pieces fall off) to excessive condensation in the headlights (which still isn’t fixed even after new headlights) and a bunch of software issues. I’ll be scheduling a new visit to the dealership soon for break-related issues.
7.	Wifi hotspot stopped working. Maybe because of my trial ending, but It stopped about week 2.
8.	The on call app is a bit limited in its utility. At this point it’s not worth paying for after the trial period ends.
9.	One last minor gripe. The manual claims that there is a power rear sunshade. I beg to differ. Found no mention of it being an option.

Overall, the car is soooo close to being perfect. My biggest concerns are with the rattling noises, uncomfortable seats, and with general software issues. I really wish I didn’t have to have a routine of turning on/off my settings every time I turn on the car. These fit-and-finish items are what hold this car back from really being able to compete against the refinement of the A6 and E class. I’m still holding out hope that these problems will be worked out in future Volvos built on this platform. "

I'd rate it four stars.  I've only have my S90 for a short time, but so far, it's everything I wanted: all-wheel drive, fuel efficient, roomy, stylish, four heated seats, individual climate control, dynamic cruise control, LED steerable lights, handless trunk, good user interface.  I have a 2015 Lexus GS 350 and the Volvo turned out to be a better value than a 2017 GS 350.  Where I live, you can't find a Lexus with comparable equipment.  And if you want a user interface that will drive you nuts, try Lexus.  

My only two complaints are that the stock stereo is a bit anemic and there are a few settings, like auto highbeams, that have to be turned on every time you get in the car.  Also, the car is more of a cruiser than a sports sedan.  However, that it is not to say that it isn't stable or sufficiently responsive.  Unlike the previous reviewer, I haven't had any problems navigating the Sensus tablet-like interface.  Nor have I found Sensus to be slow to start.  I also am able to have my iphone chord come out of the center console while keeping the console closed.  I agree that it would be nice to have more usb ports rather than cigarette lighter outlets.  I absolutely love the dynamic cruise control, which works like a charm.  I've put 10k miles on the car in six months and love it even more than when I got it. "

It was as if the entire car depended upon a Windows 95 operating system that needed de-fragmentation and rebooting every day.  Systems froze constantly but at random, providing a bad entertainment system of a sort.  Applications never worked.  Mobile WiFi connectivity was usually beyond the car's ability (displaying a nearly-ubiquitous  message of ""No connection to service"").  On my last drive the driver's seat moved on its own, the cruise control failed, the pilot assist failed, and the rear brakes (which had been replaced once) resumed their habit of bringing the car to a stop (when in reverse) with a lurch and a boom (as if I had hit something, which was never the case).  I have driven a Volvo for 33 years and still own some older ones, but I do not think I will ever buy another one.  I understand the current platform has created problems with the air conditioning system; perhaps this is Volvo's answer to global warming?

Update: I traded in the vehicle and took the loss now as opposed to later. It was only going to get worse. Months later Volvo USA sent me a nice magazine, which went immediately into the recycle bin.

Update: I still have the mindset to never buy another Volvo. "

The proportions are perfect, and the styling is classic.  The interior is the best place to be of any of the 50 plus cars I’ve owned.  The aesthetics are perfect.  The performance of my T5 AWD is what I expected, not a killer, for sure.  I knew that going in, and if performance with a capital P was totally important, I would have sprung for the T6.  My driving is mostly highway, and 250ish HP is a OK.  And now the minuses.  The corporate 4 cyl. is....well, a 4 banger.  It isn’t particularly smooth, and doesn’t sound that great either.  It’s obviously a modern motor, but suffers from a cylinder deficiency in a large car application.  Sorry Volvo, but one size really doesn’t fit all.  It isn’t a horsepower issue, it’s about refinement and smoothness.  Lastly, the ride...it’s not that great.  Even on a smooth interstate highway, you can feel too way much road.  I understand it isn’t a Rolls or Big Jag, but it isn’t an C class either.  Volvo would do well to farm out the chassis tuning if they can’t do better.  Bottom line the S90 is one or two cylinders and a more compliant chassis away from a World class near luxury sedan.

UPDATE.  Seems a large part of the road harshness was not one, but three Pirelli P Zero tires that were not able to be balanced, or maybe not exactly round.  After replacement the road noise and vibration/harmonics are hugely improved.

MY GAS MILEAGE.  Now that the S90 is well broken in, I can report Interstate mileage of 32.9 MPG on my last long trip.  This is at speed limit plus 4 mph, i.e. 64-74 mph.  My suburban every day driving is right at 25 mpg.  I am not a feather foot. "

This is the second Volvo I've owned, prior to this I owned a XC60.  I have owned a Mercedes diesel sedan and a Lexus SC400.  The S90 had most of the bells & whistles because there weren't many cars to choose from on the lot.  I love how roomy it is and the leather seats.  Favorite feature is the heads up display.  I'm looking to buy a second car but really hard to consider buying my dream sports car without the heads up display.  The reason I didn't give this a 5/5 is because I had to take my practically brand new car in when my turn signal and several other features just stopped working.  Also, the tires cost a fortune and a big chuck broke off when I parked...badly.  I do love the car for road trips because it's a smooth ride, performance is like driving a jet, and the upgraded stereo is awesome. "

Pros.
 Beautiful car and get lots of compliments.  
Great on the hiway.  
Plenty of power and great gas mileage.  However....
Cons
Car was built in China.  Rear rotors have failed at 20,000 miles and Volvo won’t pay for the repair.  Cheap Chinese steel.  
GPS programming was designed by an idiot. 
Climate control is the worst i’ve ever owned in 50 years of car owning. 
Too few buttons for direct access leads to too much time looking at center screen interface rather than at the road.  
Voice commands extremely slow to respond And sketchy at best.
Technology was totally unstable for the first 3 months of ownership.

I leased this car with the intention of buying at lease end....no longer.  Volvo can have it back.  I’m heading back to MB or Lexus.

Even my passengers ask why it shakes each time we stop and go.  Sure, I can disable by selecting Dynamic, but I do this 2-3 times a day.  I’m told Volvo will not disable due to MPG and emission fears.  Have your attorneys draft a “I agree” button to whatever makes your legal department happy.  It is so much more noticeable then my Lexus Hybrid.  I can live with the horrible voice activation and not so good GPS,and the rest of the car is perfect.  Read all the comments out there and give your customer base the option. Let us disable start/stop.  It’s our car, our right.   The only other issue is the blind side warning light is not bright enough to catch your eye.  Volvo made it an elongated strip as a design, but functionally it fails to do its job of alerting the drivers peripheral vision. "

Driving dynamics: Superior in every aspect:acceleration, braking, keeping the line, softness/firmness combination etc. 2. Radio: Could be better in a car with MSRP> 60K. 3. A/C heater fan: very loud, could be quieter in 60K car. 4. Infotainment/Comfort controls: everything is incorporated in Ipad like touch screen device. It is very confusing and it is not safe.I would change it back to buttons in a heart beat. As I said in a title: Excellent car for 325 a month. For 400 I would shop around.

It's large and quiet and packs enough punch needed to get around as well as easily entering any highway ramp.  You get to speed very quickly and it doesn't disappoint.  The touch screen is very nice and very similar to an Apple iPad.  I have no complaints.  My one minor gripe is I wish the rearview mirror dimming feature was more effective.  The mirror does not darken at all for night time driving.  Rear headlights glare in your eyes and is very distracting.  Spoke to the dealer about it and I'm told that's how it works.  Other than that it's a great car and have driven it over a year without any incident or hiccups.  It's a car and does what a car should do.  I don't do laps and I'm not racing it either.  I need it for pleasure as well as for errands and other personal use.  It's a pleasure to drive and absorbs road imperfections with ease.  The seats are first rate and have enough power adjustments to satisfy anyone regardless of weight or height.  The radio is good and I'm sure the Bowers version even better.  A four-cylinder motor that can easily compete with the best and the tranny is the smoothest I've ever experienced.  The back seats are limousine spacious and the rear right passenger has all the window and power seat adjustments for the front seat if it is unoccupied yielding more leg room than a la-z-boy.  The leather seating is top notch and probably the best out there.  I originally was not in the market for a Volvo but after searching and looking at various makes and models this one was a beauty and won me over.  It's ""stunning"" to look at and I get compliments from onlookers who can't believe it's a Volvo.  Yet it is! "

Otherwise the car will weave back and forth over lines and turn off the road at exits when lines disappear.  Lastly, the GPS is bad, and very difficult to judge distances when to turn.

It has 17K miles on it, and I have had it since 11/'18. I was told it needed a complete brake job costing $665. I never had a car before that needed a brake job done with such low mileage. All of my driving is to local stores, and an adjacent county. My son, who was with Land Rover, called an Insurance Adjuster he knew about it the brake job. The Adjuster said ""the brakes on that model do not last long at all"" it's a Volvo problem"". 
Also, for a luxury car going over the bumps in the road, you feel them, and due to the 4 wheel drive, some are teeth jarring! The tires should have been one size larger, and the shock absorption better.
Also, the car sits much lower than what I was used to of getting in and out of my previous vehicles I'm only 5'9"" and ""drop in"" and hold onto the car rail to get out comfortably. . 
It has all the latest tech& safety features, beautiful design, plush interior, and performs well on the highway, when passing power is needed.

Review +1 year,5,"I generally favor sportier cars, but now I am driving a Volvo S90 T5 which I got at a lease price that I could not refuse!  [Actually less per month that my former Infiniti Q50.]  So I will say I got a lot of bang for the buck.   This is a luxury car that one would not mind being chauffeured in.  The rear passenger area is HUGE and comfortable.  I can finally sit in front passenger seat and not even have to think about adjusting the seat for rear passages leg room.  The Driver’s seat is very pleasant for sitting and was designed by a Orthopedist.  The package came with a Blonde (white) interior which (needs occasional cleaning), is wonderful and elegant.  I would say it is the most nicely appointed car I ever owned.  (And I have and had several MB and BMWs).
   The Tech is amazing!  Though sometimes touch screen  is a bit overwhelming.  The great thing is that you can put the car on Auto Assist Pilot, play with it without worrying about hitting anything on the road.  (PS I do not support being a distractive driver, but this practically eliminates it under the right conditions.  Always be alert).
The Auto Assist Pilot is from the future.  It is not quite at Tesla level, but does much to keep you very safe while also removing the the tedium of Stop and Go traffic.  Driving is now an ‘AHHH”.  (My insurance rates actually went down when ordering this car.). It is a wonderfully solid vehicle.  I will lend this Car to anyone of my family and know they will be safe in it.  Gotta love that Swedish engineering. 
The trade off is the sporty feel of performance.  The Volvo is powerful for a 4 cylinder, and I get 25.5 mpg.  (Again better than my past Infinity).  0-60 is quite good for a car this size, but you do lose the ‘feel’ of lungeing  acceleration. (But you can use electronic options). It is a great luxury (family) car before it is a sports car.  The ride is firm as you ‘float’ over the road.   It’s very nice and quiet.  Long trips are a pleasure. All in all, it is a car to enjoy the ride in.  If you can get great deal on this extremely plush car, don’t hesitate.  (P.S. also drove the Volvo S60 for the while.  The ride and feel of the S90 is much better). 
   {A buying note: Volvo pricing is company set and it is difficult to negotiate a lower price When visiting other dealers.  There is not much wiggle room so choose the dealership with the best service.}

1 Year Later - still the most comfortable car I ever owned.  A pleasure to take a ride in for long road trips. 
Pros: Orthopedically Seats 5 w/ enough backseat legroom to play football in.  No more squishing upfront seat to allow backseat room.  Trunk is large doesn’t seem to be.  I guess it is the awkward design.  Low but deep.  I Love how in winter seats & steering wheel heat up to settings automatically when temp is below 40 degrees.  3 individual temp settings (not even my son’s Tesla S has that.). The Swedes made it solid and sure foot in harsh weather.  It is my go-to car in snow and slush.  Much better handling than my wife’s Mercedes C Class (which isn’t bad).  This car is tank-like sturdy.   An idiot SUV driver already backed into my rear fender in a parking lot, and l had no major damage. Have no doubt it will do a great job protecting passengers and family in a crash.  (HF).

 Con: I still find the screen controls cumbersome and confusing.  The car has  only driver 1 USB, so had to plug in a hub to use both phone and SD music card (no biggie).  I have found that the autopilot is not perfect.  It will veer of the road (not follow the road lines in certain situations, [with steep curves in road at higher speeds) so keep you hands on the wheel and pay some attention, [so NO napping!], but it is still a great feature 90% of the time.. But Is still a pleasure to take the stress out of everyday driving.  
Still love this car as the next evolution in driving. "

After owning just about every vehicle made, including  Bentleys, Lambos, S600s, S63s, 911s, Panameras, 7 Series Range Rovers.... and the list goes on. 

I never considered buying a Volvo until recently seeing an S90 driving down the freeway. I instantly fell in love with the exterior styling/design. The following day I drove to our local Volvo dealership, and drove the S90 Inscription and S90 R-Design. I purchased the R-Design as I prefer a sportier look.  This vehicle has not stopped amazing me at how well it drives, handles, it’s interior styling/design and of course the plethora of safety features and amenities. The Pilot Assist operates like a dream. Since buying, I constantly catch people staring at the vehicle  while driving next to me or even passing me going the opposite direction. 

The value is unbelievable. The car handles perfectly. The leg room in the back seats are amazing. And if you want more power, RaceChip offers 3 choices of a plug & play tuner offering a variety of driving options, all of which can be changed using the app on your smart phone. The version I purchased increases the HP output by a whopping 77 ponies AND increases the torque by an am amazing 77 pounds. I’ve purchased A RaceChip brand tuner before, having installed it on my Panamera 4S. It’s never disappointed me, an has performed perfectly. If you need to take the vehicle into service, you simply unplug it, throw it in your backpack and it’s impossible for a technician to detect one was ever installed. IMO RaceChip (a German company) is the best tuner on the market. Offering 7 different driving tunes, all controlled by your smart phone. Like I said, after it’s  unplugged and removed from the engine compartment, there is no record of it ever being installed. 

Overall I could not be happier with this vehicle, and could spend hours/pages describing how it’s the best car I’ve ever owned, not only in performance, but in styling and especially in terms of value. The car looks and feels like it should cost 20k to 40k more. 

In fact, I liked it so much and my wife liked it so much, that I went back to Volvo the following day and purchased a 2020 S60 Inscription with every option available. The salesman drove it to my house, where I left it parked under our Porte-Cache with the keys on our front step and a note. She was so excited when she came home to her surprise, especially when figuring out it is shorter/smaller than the S99, since she  prefers a shorter/smaller sedan while I prefer one that is bigger/longer. 

I can’t remember the last time she was this excited over a new vehicle. 

Soooo, if you’re in the market for a new vehicle, DO NOT  purchase anything until you sit in one of Volvo’s completely redesigned models and  test drive them all.  Make sure to toggle through the factory equipped driving modes, take it on the freeway and experience the variety of tech/safety features. I promise you will not be disappointed, especially when comparing pricing to Volvo’s German competitors. The value is astoundingly GREAT. 

Once you drive one, you’ll purchase one, because THESE CARS DO NOT DISAPPOINT.  "

My 2003 9-5 Aero wagon was a great car to drive, being very comfortable with plenty of cargo space. However at 266k miles, with a daily 90 mile commute, it was time to replace it. I wanted a car as comfortable as it, which is not easy to find. Most cars have poor front seats for long term driving comfort. I like to move around a lot of stuff and need cargo space, hence my interest in only wagons. I briefly considered the 328 wagon - I like its exterior styling, however as typical BMW their seats are uncomfortable to me and you sit too low in the car. My wife recently leased a 320 (drives nice; seats and ergonomics suck), and I sat in every car at the dealer from 2 to 7 series and all of the seats are far less comfortable than those in my V60. I also have a lot of concern about their long-term reliability since I try to keep my cars to 200k+ miles. I also considered the VW Golf wagon, but it wasn't as quiet on the freeway as I would like. I tried and bought a new 2015.5 V60 T5 Drive-E with sport seats and suspension and have enjoyed it every day since I bought it. It's now nearly 3 years old and already has 70k miles and has not had any reliability problems. I recently replaced the tires with the same Pirellis that came with car. It is quiet and smooth at highway speeds and corners tightly and confidently. Front seats are very comfortable and need a little time to break in. Front visibility is great with no glare. I like the control layout and enjoy listening to satellite radio every day. Bluetooth connection to my phone is reliable and telephone sound quality is excellent. My only complaint was the stock acceleration was not quite as strong feeling as I enjoyed with my Saab. However that was fixed and the car transformed when I recently bought the Polestar Performance Optimization software for the car. It can be easily downloaded and installed at any Volvo dealer. With the new software, it now passes very quickly on the freeway while also improving the throttle and transmission behavior. Highway gas mileage in unchanged. This is now one hell of a European car! To me the V60 T5 Drive-E with Polestar software is the best currently available balance of comfort, safety, driving experience, fuel economy, and storage capacity. Highly recommended! "

Or line up for your favorite pseudo-sporty crossover.   But if you're dying for an immensely likeable and practical wagon, the V60 really checks all the boxes.   Seriously folks... the V60 is a Volvo at heart (incredible seats, up-to-date and seamless safety features) with enough spunk and sport to make things interesting.   I went with the FWD version, and am consistently getting mid 20's gas mileage around town, and mid 30's on the highway.  Huge plus -- the 4-cylinder turbo is a VAST improvement over the 5-cylinder turbo I had on my older S60.  Lag is minimal, and the whoosh is maximal.    The ride is Euro firm yet comfortable -- and until I export the car (and my career) to some village in the Swiss Alps, the handling has plenty of bite for everyday driving.  Other positives -- the Sensus system is pretty intuitive, and if you are carting around younger children (roughly 4 to 8 years old) do yourself a HUGE favor and find a V60 with the integrated booster seats.   Incredible option -- almost worth the price of admission for any parent.   

No matter how capable the V60 is -- my hunch is that it will get lost in the compact wagon and SUV shuffle.   No screaming BMW badge... no butch plastic on the outside to make you think you're ready to scale Everest.  But consider it your gain.  I got a pretty aggressive deal from my local dealer since these aren't exactly flying off the showroom floor.   And while the rear seat is plenty roomy for kids and teens -- I don't think a 6-footer would want to hang out in the backseat for an extended trip. "

I paid at least $12k more for comparable German cars, and didn't get anywhere near the value or features found in this car. Chose FWD because w/traction control, it's nearly as good as AWD.

I have the V60 T5 Drive E. 2.0T 240Hp 8 speed, double clutch auto. E is for economy, and for highways, it really works, good for an easy 3 to 5 mpg increase if you let it work and keep the speed reasonable.  Very high quality feel to everything in the car, the plastics don't feel cheap, don't rattle, and have great texture. You have to watch the rear brakes, the electronic emergency bake eats the inside pad. I bought the car in 2018 with 66,000 miles on it, and it's over 91000 now. no issues. CONS, no transmission or engine dipstick. no coolant access to check levels, battery is hard to get to, and oil filter requires a large pan be removed, so every time you let someone change the oil, you risk them losing screws, or overtightening and damaging the skid plate mounts. leather is really nice, but it is ungodly HOT, and stays that way for the entire drive. Air conditioning is slow to cool the car, once cool, it does well, but its annoying that it can't cool it down before I sweat into the seats. Nav system is unusable it is so cumbersome to program. car really needed a touchscreen for this function. it's tolerable because I can bluetooth my phone to the car and use it's navigation app.    I love this car, depending on how long it lasts without major issues, I will buy another Volvo when it is time to replace this one.

Update.
Volvo has overly complicated PCV and thermostat systems. 
Volvo doesn’t tell you ANYTHING in the scheduled maintenance about the PCV system routinely clogging up and causing excessive oil use as the turbo sucks excess trapped oil out of the PCV reservoir. Left unchecked, the engine will run rough, start leaking, and if ignored, destroy itself. 
It’s ungodly expensive to replace, the part alone being $150 to $240 depending retail or dealer. 

Same for the thermostat, I had no idea it was bad, no lights, temperature seemed fine, but since there isn’t any way to inspect coolant, and no codes present (we’ll get to that) I had no idea it was bad. $550 to replace it. 

Codes, did you know Volvo locked down maintenance reference material in 2015? Code readers won’t read many volvo alerts, and there are no manuals, even for shops, unless you go to Volvo dealerships. So I got a code regarding the PCV system, but the coolant system only had messages within the on board computers that only Volvo can access. 

I still love the car, but sadly I will not buy another due to these maintenance issues. It would be different if I could go to my mechanic, but I have to drive to a Volvo shop 110 miles away for service and that don’t fly with me.  "

What attracted me to this car is that it does not look like a wagon but more like a crossover without the height and extra cost. There is one caveat however. My car came with a start/stop feature. I've gotten used to it but for some they may not. It's the feeling of an engine stalling and starting up again. You can however manually shut it off. My wife hates it. I leave on just to annoy her.

Our dealer only had AWD in stock, but wanted FWD with the new Turbocharged Drive-E 4cyl engine/8-speed transmission. What a great combo of power/torque and gas economy. Easy 30+ mpg highway. 

Two options ordered were the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) and heated fabric seats (all)…one of the few cars you can buy heated seats without leather. Base model also lacks the roof rails, also my preference for a cleaner look. And base model dashboard I prefer over the upgrade electronic dashboard.

Best Features:  engine/trans combination, classic Volvo seating perfect for my 6’ size, 36,000 miles of maintenance included, and Euro styling.

Worst Feature:  1) Excessively aggressive start/stop. Learned to use the paddle-shifter Left to disable in traffic and in anticipation of signal light change and turns. I doubt the feature really saves very much. Just one unplanned repair of this feature in the life of the car will more than negate any fuel saving.
2) No Oil Dipstick in the Drive-E Engine…ugh!

Also considered the Audi A3 but arrogance of dealer turned me off, and would have also considered a Saab had they not gone broke.

Wife has the XC60, and I prefer the V60 as a driver’s car.

Tip:  Free 6 months of Sirius has expiration date, so activate your free period promptly. Had to negotiate with Sirius to get my full 6 months.

The only nit I would pick are the comments about the controls of the Sensus electronics system. The review mentions that the control via a dial on the central instrument panel is less than optimal.  I would agree if this was the only way to control the various systems such as media, navigation, internet, etc.  However, all of these systems can alternatively be controlled via the curled knob and a couple of pads located on the right hand of the steering wheel with your right hand thumb.  Personally, I hardly ever use the dial on the center instrument cluster and use the steering wheel controls for entering radio, sirius, internet, navigation and phone inputs which I feel is at least as convenient as a central console mouse type control because you can leave both hands on the steering wheel while controlling these systems.

After 18 months and 22,000 miles of ownership the car is still performing as new.  Gas mileage is averaging about 30 mpg which is exceeding my expectations considering its performance and comfort. The only maintenance has been two Dealer 10K oil changes and checkups at no cost to me. The only changes to the car I would recommend are faster than 3G internet and the cars rather wide turning radius makes parking in tight spots a little challenging. The driver and passenger front seats are very comfortable on all day drives. 

I have now driven my V60 38,000 miles with no problems.  Only routine 10K service and absolutely no repairs or issues with the car.  I use it primarily for road trips and average over 30 mpg.  The seats are really comfortable on all day drives and the leather looks new but I clean and treat the leather upholstery about twice a year so I'm sure that helps.  I replaced the OEM Continental tires after only 25K miles because they became very noisy. The Pirelli P7 tires on the car now are much quieter and seem to be wearing well.

Now I have 43,500 miles with no problems.  Only regular 10K service and no repairs.  The 40K service (the first I had to pay for) seemed a bit expensive but I choose to have the brake fluid changed because I live in the humid southeast which added to the cost. I continue to get 30+mpg in mostly highway driving. "

We were really skeptical on the MPG claims, but it does fairly close to it (if you can resist the temptation to enjoy the surprising pickup). We generally  are ""green drivers"" and get better than usual miles, but I still doubted the 37mpg highway claim. Yet, this morning, I got 33 in a 15mi city drive from my kids' school to the office (A/C on as it was ~90F outside), but this is Raleigh NC traffic (mild). This weekend we had the car loaded with 2x large adults, 2x kids(in giant, heavy, 5 point boosters), 2x 10gl coolers full of drinks and ice, a small bag of clothes, 2 large picnic blankets, 2 folding chairs, and a 60lbs dog, but we still did 29mpg in a mix drive(60mi city/25mi hwy) of 85mi (round trip). The trunk space is great. All that stuff fit and the giant poodle still could stretched out on his bed. The software for trip computer and other things could be simpler, and the breaks feel too smooth for people that enjoy the sporty action of an audi, but the car is excellent in every other way. Ohhhhhhh, the seats are amazing.

Updates: over a year in and we continue to be very happy with this Volvo. It is comfortable, has ample space for us, it is versatile, drives like a sports car(except for soft/smooth breaks), and gets decent mileage if driven accordingly. Only snag is that the cell app is impossible to get working for us, so I don't get to turn it on before getting out of the house, etc. "

Performance of this model is decent - I have the AWD with the older 2.5 T5 and the 5sp auto. I like the known reliability of the older engine, although the performance and fuel economy of the newer one was appealing, it wasn't an option in this model year, and I was looking for a lightly used vehicle. 

2015.5 for electronics is key - better nav, better 'infotainment' with an upgraded Sensus setup. The car has a built-in wifi hotspot (it's ATT service, and free until Volvo figures out how to pass thru charges) in addition to OnCall (Volvo's version of OnStar) and Sirius traffic is free for 4 years from original sale date.

Seats are very comfy - I don't have the sport package, which has larger bolstered seats, but I do have the Climate package, so everything that should be heated or cooled is done automatically. Storage is smallish for a wagon, but still useful.

Styling of both outside and inside is nice - very Swedish still, which is good - I was glad to see that Geely didn't distract from that or the safety of Volvo when they purchased the company.

My focus was on a crossover SUV, with the top three eventually being (in no particular order) the Volvo XC60, Acura RDX and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid.  I test drove all three cars more than once and still couldn't determine a clear favorite.  One evening, I read Edmunds review of the Volvo V60 wagon, which I hadn't researched, but was very interested in the car after reading the review.  I test drove the car a few days later and liked it, and the following weekend, took my spouse to the dealership to try the car, not intending to get one that day.  We were both really impressed with the handling, the zippy drive, and the way it felt on the freeway and on the city streets.  We decided to try the XC60 again while we were there for an immediate comparison, but I got behind the wheel of the V60 one more time and knew it wasn't necessary to drive another car; this one was it, and we drove it home that evening.  Basically, the V60 is very similar to the XC60, just doesn't have the SUV height.  The seats are so comfortable, the dash and instrumentation clear and easy to read, and the best feature for me is the blind spot monitor which is built into the post rather than the side mirror, which I much prefer.  This is a solid vehicle, with excellent pick-up and acceleration and a very smooth ride and very good gas mileage.  I wanted the new safety features available on today's cars which was the reason for the new car, and they are totally worth it.  Backed out of the driveway the other day, and the cross traffic alert let me know that a car was speeding down our street.  Very clear picture in the back-up camera and navigation screen.  All the bells and whistles are easy to program.  V60 scored well on all the safety tests, which was a must for me.  Very happy with the decision, and I am looking for reasons to get in the car and drive it!

6-Month Update:  Still love this car.  Seat comfort is outstanding.  We have driven it on a couple of road trips, and the ride is smooth and comfortable.  Air conditioning is spot on, and the sound system is fine, even though we didn't get an upgraded system.  Gas mileage has been good, too, especially on the highway on the trips we have taken.  Two things I particularly love:  the blind spot monitor and the rear view through the back window.  Re the blind spot: the amber light is positioned perfectly on the interior of the car rather than on the outside mirrors as it is on other vehicles.  It is not intrusive at all and is a useful tool when planning to change lanes.  I also really like the view out the back window looking through the rear view mirror.  When the backseat headrests are reclined, it is like looking through a picture window!  Even when the headrests are in the up position, it is still a clear, big view out the back window.  And, the car is fun to drive.  Zippy and responsive.  No complaints or remorse after six months; I really like this car.  My husband enjoyed driving this car so much that he got an Inscription S60, which is proving to be just as satisfactory to him. "

We were unfortunate members of the VW Dieselgate scandal, and decided to sell our car back to VW and upgrade. While I do miss the sportier handling of my VW, this car is amazing and feels so professional. Also, a week after we bought this car, an Uber driver bashed into my passenger side; without the heavy profile of this car (1-3 tons), I would have been knocked into the next lane and probably been in two accidents. The BLIS safety system helped me prove my case to the insurance company that the other driver was at fault because I saw the BLIS light up as he veered into my lane and was able to share this with my insurance company. Because of all of the safety features of this car, our insurance actually went down from where it had been with my VW. This car will haul you-know-what onto the freeway and turns itself off when you are sitting in traffic, which in LA is a lot. I am not in love with the slow charging USB port, but nothing is perfect.

First was a 2013 S60 T5 (5-cylinder) and because I liked it so much I got a 2016 V60 T5 wagon (4-cylinder). Having always been an ""Audi"" guy (I still think they’re great), I find the Volvo S & V60 out-performs the Audi for city and highway driving (that’s where I drive 80% + of the time) because of its less harsh/ comfortable suspension and its great/ fantastic seats. Also, I find the V60's engine performance is essentially perfect for the real roads of life here in southern California (that coming from a heavy foot), along with its wonderful 8 speed transmission, which has a sport mode that’s great for quicker shifting - performance, driving in the canyons, around town and particularly in bumper to bumper traffic, where it seems to intuitively know when to stay in gear/ not shift.
Also, what I like about Volvo’s in general, is there low key great, kind of timeless good looks that project a different, less in your face, “if you will” presence than Audi, BMW, Mercedes. In addition, they are less expensive as well.
In conclusion, “If” I wanted my 2016 Volvo V60 T5 to handle closer/ more similar on twisty roads to my previous Audi’s (they are “GREAT/ better” in that area), then all I need to do is get some 18”/ 19” rims that are a bit wider, higher performance tires, also a Polestar chip would not be bad as well. However, for how I use my car, this change is not necessary. "

The starting price for 2019 on the T5 Momentum was $38,900. I fell in love with the cloth (City Weave) seats only offered on this trim so it wasn't a hard decision.  

You don't need all the bells and whistles. I saved over $5,000 skipping the Advanced and Multimedia packages. Volvo's navigation is unnecessary now that Apple Carplay and Android Auto allow for Google maps and I honestly don't mind the smaller 8"" digital display for the driver. The base stereo wasn't that bad compared to the mid-level HK either.

The default auto braking system when backing into traffic was a little startling at first - especially in city traffic. But I had no problem reducing the sensitivity through the touch screen. Then again, I’m the type of guy who really enjoys going through the manual and clicking through every feature until I am familiar with the system. I actually love how many things are customizable. A lot of journalists complain about the HVAC controls in the touch screen however I use the voice command system to adjust the temp. with no issues.

This was in the running with the top trim Subaru Outback and VW Alltrack. The Alltrack was a little more tossable in the corners even with its lifted ride height. I really was surprised by how much fun it was to drive - so much so that we test drove it twice! The VW was definitely the runner-up simply for its driving dynamics. The Outback’s CVT was a deal breaker - not mention it’s hideous looking (subjective, I know). The only thing I really enjoyed about the Subaru was how big it felt on the inside - especially the back seats. In the end we chose the base Volvo for a few thousand more. It’s more comfortable, quiet, and luxurious inside. The egress and ingress is what you’d expect compared to a CUV but I don’t have any issues putting my kid in his rear-facing child seat. The cargo is big enough for our family’s needs. 

I totally get why people hate on the new Volvo touch screen. Having the HVAC on the screen is definitely not my preference but the Volvo voice command system is great. We test drove a lot of CUVs and wagons (Outback, Alltrack, TourX, Hybrid Rav4, etc) and the Volvo screen was by far the most responsive - especially with the new chip update. Luckily there is still a button for max defrost. Would I prefer more physical buttons? Sure. But have you seen the body lines on the V60 wagon? It’s a worthy trade-off. In the end, it’s by far the most beautiful car I’ve ever owned. I’ve never looked back at my car in the parking lot until owning this V60.

Quiet at speed, relaxing to drive but also fun and willing when pushed a bit. Sensus system is often criticized, but it makes sense to me and can be controlled from steering wheel, unlike competitors' systems.  The keypad that some consider ""dated"" adds functionality.

In 3 years of ownership, 26000 miles, no reliability issues aside from occasional hiccups with the infotainment system which would self-correct when car re-started.

UPDATE 
60000 miles later, I still love it

FIRST POST 
I looked at the Outback, the Audi, the BMW, the Benz, and the Volvo V60 CC. I studied all, test drove them and most importantly checked out cargo area. I spent 6 months researching!  The Volvo V 60 CC was the only one which fit my criteria of 1. Total driver seat comfort (like sitting in your favorite easy chair) 2. Handling (tight steering and a sporty-feel) 3. Able to carry 4 sets of golf clubs without removing any clubs from the bags (Yes, including drivers!).  I have two complaints. 1. the backup camera is on the outside of the car and will fog up with rain/snow 2. The tailgate is MANUAL and should be automatic.
The more I drive this car (past  year and 1/2) the more I love it!  And the dealerships I have worked with are great. "

Smaller than our Outback was (more like our 2008 than our 2012 in rear seating) and also uses regular gas for it's 5 cylinder turbo engine. It drives okay for me in sports mode ONLY. Otherwise programmed to be slow and be more fuel efficient. Great seats. Better than my Audi S5's premium leather seats. Bought it Certified pre-owned (demo) with 7K miles. Over 3 years left on original warranty plus Volvo adds a 3 year certification. BMW, Audi, etc. add 2 years for CPO & Mercedes only 1.  I like the styling much more than the former Volvo wagons that looked like refrigerators on wheels.  This is a sleek modern looking vehicle. Like a maxi version on the former cute little C70 which I liked as much as Mini's if not more. Like most al wheel drive cars the mileage isn't great in the city. He just enough pep, but no faster than our former Outback 3.6R. However the Outback had no sport mode to add pep when passing or accelerating. It's smaller than the Outback which I like for city parking. Rear space is small for a wagon, but with rear seats folded down there is plenty of room. It held five tires easily when I changes tires from all the Scorpion all-seasons. I run summer and winter tires always. The brakes are a weak point. Much longer stopping distance than a car at this price should require. Being bought for safety it's disappointing and needs a fix. The better tires help a bit. I like the keyless entry and the auto folding side mirrors which fold when you lock the car for parking. The rear windows inhibit viability, but that's the design. Our other option to the Outback was the Audi Cross Country. The option was too expensive and not a faster car. The Volvo parts are outrageous! I wanted a set of wheels for winter snow tires, but they were $500/each. If one of the OEM wheels has to be replaced that's the cost. The Tire Rack doesn't have this cars fitment yet so until they get one to spec out I can't buy winter tires. I suspect that this is not a big a seller as the FWD V60 which is less expensive and lower. We needed the Cross Country for it's height for snow clearance. We get too much! I blast our wagons out of the long driveway rather than shovel. My Audi S5 doesn't have much clearance though AWD. I prefer not to use it in heavy snow though I run high performance winter tires (Dunlap winter sports) in one size down from the OEM 19s. I plan to buy W80s or Xice3's for the Volvo once I find reasonably priced wheels. No way I'm buying Volvo wheels at their pricing.
I bought W80s for snow and ice. Haven't had any bad weather to try them out. Rides well on these tires. Found really nice wheels from the tire rack. 
The electronics are limited to use with an AT&T mobile device (only) which is ridiculous. I use Verizon, so I can't use many features. Very sore point. 
On the positive side I stumbled onto a power mode feature that the dealership was not even aware of on this wagon. Rather than being part of the features you choose on the center console, it is on the turn signal! You choose power mode (1 of 3 choices) and put the shifter in sport mode and the car changes character from a slug to a car with zip. Now it stays in power mode!! I never use sport mode until the car warms up. Better safe than sorry. 
Overall I still think this car was a good choice. With Buick bringing the Opel wagon over from Europe where it is very popular, I may change my mind. I'll wait to see the Opel with the Buick badging.
Mileage on this car is disappointing. in spite of my sporty driving habits. "

My 2013 Outback is great but I gave it to my daughter and it left me wanting a little better handling. The cargo area is practical but not huge. The cabin area is not huge but it fits me well. The car has roof rails for a roof rack and the roof height is practical for loading. I really like the way the car rides and drives but it's not a sports car. The thing feels solid and the whole package inspires confidence. AWD, slightly elevated ride height, wagon utility and drives like a premium car. Frosting on the cake: runs on regular unleaded gas.
Update February 2019: I still love my V60 CC. I have not had any problems with the car. My local Volvo dealer closed so I have to drive further for service which is a bummer. I had to make a high speed evasive maneuver on highway 130. The speed limit is is 85 MPH and the wind blew an unsecured traffic barrier into my path.

This is the most aesthetically attractive wagon in the world right now-- in my opinion. Car is tight, gets reasonable MPG-- averaging about as well as our 2017 outback but with 50% more power. Smaller but still very efficiently designed to maximize room. E.g., it's about 20 cubic feet less storage than the outback with seats down, but because the front seat slides further forward, I can easily fit my 7'-6"" surfboard in the back-- which was a stretch for my Outback. Pano sunroof is gorgeous and standard. Interior is much nicer than the Outback, much tighter fit and finish. No issues so far with about 6K miles. Only minor electrical gremlin is the driver mirror appears to randomly adjust itself sometimes when the car starts. I wasn't a fan of the driver computer initially but after a few days it becomes intuitive and is much better than the new Outback. Also engine can be a little rougher than say an Audi or X3, and perhaps even the new Outback XT, but still pretty quiet and a tranquil drive overall.

Subaru dealer was very rude and unmotivated about selling us a new Outback when our 2017 lease expired, so we got a great lease deal with OC Volvo for less than the price of an Outback XT. If you want something unique and more luxurious than an outback, v60 CC is it.  "

I learned to drive in a Volvo 245 wagon, so in a way, this is coming home.  After years of owning Saabs (sedan and convertible), I switched to Volvo 5 years, picking up an AWD S60.  It has been a great commuter car for me, but at times I felt constrained if I wanted to shop at Home Depot or Costco on my way home for work.  My wife has driven the Grand Caravan, then Touareg and now Audi Q5s.

The V60 CC is as capable a vehicle as you will find, albeit not as sporty as some.  The seats are luxurious, and I never tire of sitting in them for a long drive--or just a quick hop.  The three variants of driving experience--Eco, Comfort, and Dynamic provide different settings to suit your mood.  Dynamic is my preferred for rush hour, but the vehicle is heavy enough that it really is not a ""sport driving"" vehicle.  I'm still thinking about the Polestar optimization, but the $1600 upcharge gives me pause. Eco setting has best mileage, but has long slow shifts, so save it for when you are not in a hurry.  The standard Comfort setting, on as default at start, is really a good all purpose driving experience. 

Fit and finish has been excellent.  Complaints about little interior storage are valid, but as the usually sole occupant, it is ample. The standard stereo lacks some brightness and low range bass that I enjoyed on the Harmon Kardon system in my S60.  If music is really important to your driving experience, I would recommend upgrading the sound system. 

Amazing safety gear--even automatically avoids collisions if I should start to change lanes and a care has moved into my blind spot.

I bought my car in June 2020, when there were many incentives, so the price was quite good with 0% financing.  I'm a Costco member, which really helped with the transaction experience and cost.

Overall, a great vehicle for dealing with whatever mission you are going on, and wish to be comfortable to boot. "

The Advance package with pilot assist is a joy when driving along the highway and has already saved our butts in crazy Seattle traffic a couple times, definitely worth it. The interior with the cross country pro package is extremely well appointed and by far the most comfortable car I’ve ever owned. Once you learn the central tablet layout and system it’s not a chore to quickly and effectively use it. 
Have about 5,000 miles on the odometer with 90% of it being city driving on poor roads and there’s no squeaks or rattles anywhere in the cabin. Driving this car is a calming experience in any traffic or weather, great ground clearance for getting to trail heads and ski resorts, and it gets a lot of looks as you just don’t see many wagons like this out in the wild; especially among a sea of bland crossovers and SUV’s. The T5 also has plenty of power to glide you efficiently to highway speeds and easy overtaking on mountain passes. If you’re looking you should pick one up, you won’t regret it.  "

I don't care for the 4 cylinder noise under hard acceleration, but it does the job and otherwise is quiet and comfortable. The massaging seats and Bowers&Wilkins stereo are fantastic additions.

The V90 T6 is responsive even at high altitudes, gets very good gas mileage, and does amazing in all weather. Volvo really thought of everything with the technology. If you can afford the Bowers and Wilkins sound system, get it. It’s the best sound system I’ve ever heard. The touch screen is actually very intuitive and easy to learn. One of my favorite parts about this car is the app. You can send directions to it ahead of time, easily track mileage for work, remote start from anywhere, and it tells you if you’ve left the car unlocked and let’s you lock it. The safety features in the car are amazing. My favorite is it’s self driving feature which works great even in substantial rain and low light. I love using it when I’m stuck in traffic.

Lots of room for cargo I’m a package that maximizes comfort.

My only gripe is that the T5 model that I have, while sufficiently powered, does not provide that “it” factor to the performance hound in me. That said, in a luxury wagon, I am not sure if I really need that and this car is perfectly sufficient to  rack up speeding violations at any rate.

Volvo accessories are unnecessarily expensive, which is a bummer, but if you are buying a Volvo and not expecting that, then you are kind of a Dufus anyway.

All things considered, this may be the best family car on the market. 

Also... this survey sucks, as it didn’t give me the option to select the T5 model that I have, only the T6. Maybe edmunds could throw me down the extra scratch for the T6. An additional 70hp, while totally unnecessary, would be quite fun and well received on my end. "

The wagonese look is a personal thing,  it just looks great.   Try one!

1 year update.  I have put on a lot of miles without any issues.  The V90 remains stunning, comfortable and the sound system rocks.  28.2 MPG is pretty darn good.  It remains a rare site on the roads.  Sadly I will be trading it only because we have a lot of snow here and we are in a very rural area, like no county road service and a long gravel drive.  We cam back from a December trip and still had 24” of snow on the ground, and the driveway.   It is a hike to get to the side by side which I use to tamp the snow down.   Luckily a neighbor with a front loader came to the rescue.   The V90 is competent in snow but 24” is too much, my neighbors have always said, “you need a truck”.   They are right and will provide a new review with a likely Lexis GX460 soon, or Tundra.   

I must add that my wife’s 2019 XC60 remains in the stable and also has 30K miles without mishap.  SHe loves it and we used it for our trip into Utah.  It too has the B&W sound system and it perfect all ways... except it too would be challenged with 24”of snow.   It is a keeper. "

There are only 4 or 5 fan speeds available, also -- unlike the older system with buttons/dials, where you could control the fan speed much better.  They have also removed the ability to turn off auto-door-locking when the car starts to move, as well as the ability to turn off auto-start/stop and the ability to start in individual mode when the car starts up.  I can't get the radio/audio to not turn on when I turn on the engine.  The driving mode dial is in a horrible location and it's very finicky -- very poor design (this should be on the steering wheel, not in the center console near the cupholders).  The transmission is horrendous -- widely noted in reviews online; it has troubles changing gears smoothly, and this is very annoying to the driver.  The engine is just too small (2-liter, 4-cylinder) for a big, heavy car; having both superchargers and turbochargers seem like big problems waiting to happen down the road, and I wouldn't want this car out of warranty.  There's no option for a CD player in this car.  The gas tank is too small.  Read the Swedespeed.com owners forum to see all the problems owners have with this car.

I tried a few controlled fish-tails and nothing...wouldn't slide around the icy turns...braking was good on ice too.  Very well done!  Love the sexy look and the sexy drive...took it on the highway, looked down and I was doing 92 and didn't even feel it.....of course I slowed down!  I am 6'6"" and traded in my E350 wagon for this wagon and would never go back.  The seats are so comfortable, I just want to go on a road trip!  As a guy with a Quaker background, I love the plainness of the interior.  It simply takes about 20 minutes to get yourself familiar with the electronics.  Wish this model has the better stereo!  But all in all, I like it!   "

524,XC40,2018,4.1, 01/11/2019,Raoul Watson,T5 R-Design 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),51 of 52 people found this review helpful,An awesome compact SUV part 1,4,"This is the first Volvo I have ever owned in my life, my previous car was a 2015 Chevy Impala (see my review on the Impala). I always wanted a Volvo but always was apprehensive due to design and reliability reports from owners. The 2019 XC 40 however, seems to be a very solid crossover/SUV border lining a luxurious car.

1. Appearance: The 2019 Volvo XC 40 is a very handsome looking compact SUV. It is the smallest version of the Volvo SUV and it seems a good crossover for ""SUV beginners"" like me. I like the fact that it is not too tall which would make entry a challenge.
Everything on the outside points to a very well thought off design. I was a little surprised that the placement of the side mirror on the side door is not a little bit further to the front. Because of this further back placement, when the driver looks at the side view mirror, there is a gap between the vehicle body and the mirror, which to me is a little annoying and takes a little getting used to.

2. Performance: The 2.0 liter turbocharged four cylinder 248-hp engine, 8 speed auto transmission is impressive. Just a little push on the gas and it goes from zero to sixty in about 7 seconds. The handling is nimble and almost sporty. The powertrain is quick and responsive but it has an annoying start and stop system. As with most newer cars, when you stop, the XC 40 idles the engine completely down to a point that the engine is shut off. This system would cause an abrupt jerking when restarting. The SUV would lurch forward when starting up from a stop light. It takes a while getting used to but I found out that it is better to release the brakes and wait two second before applying acceleration to avoid the lurching.

3. Safety: The XC 40 is loaded with the safety features found in luxury cars and as always, Volvo is synonymous with safety. ABS, traction, and stability control comes standard along with Volvo's City Safety package. This includes automatic emergency braking along with sensors to detect other vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and other city perils in the vehicle’s path. It includes adaptive cruise control; forward collision warning; lane departure warning; blind spot warning (on the side mirrors); and rear cross-traffic alert making it the most complete crash avoidance system you can get. The optional Pilot Assist / driver assistance system is impressive. I tested it one evening and found that the system has good judgement identifying lane markings and responding to vehicles surrounding us. As a pilot I am not a stranger in trusting an ""autopilot"" system but with a car, because of the visualization interpretation, I would not be very comfortable trusting it 100%. For example, in NY the presence of highway construction means lanes are repainted so multiple crossing lanes would just confuse the pilot assist. So I would use it only on long distance good quality highways. The adaptive cruise control is convenient. It slows the vehicle during traffic slowdowns, and even stop the car to resume progress all on its own. With the addition of daylight running light of beautiful LEDs, all these safety features will give you a handsome insurance discount.

4. Ergonomics: In this department Volvo did not fare very well in my opinion. The human interface of the controls of this car is not always logical. For starters, the gear/transmission shifter it's horrible. It requires a two-step action. For example, to engage reverse or drive, one must move the gear selector twice; one to the back, then in the appropriate direction to select drive or reverse. This is extremely annoying during parking maneuvers and is very frustrating. Of course the argument could be that I should use the automated parking assistance but the shifter is just very unnatural for drivers. While you can operate almost every control from the steering wheel and the voice recognition is a nice addition, the central control screen is extremely convoluted and requires a high degree of learning curve. Coming from Volvo, particularly because it sees itself as a safety brand, the central control screen is just unsafe because it is almost impossible to operate safely while driving. There are too many unintuitive multiple taps, swipes and scrolls necessary to navigate the system. In addition, the system is awfully slow to respond. For example, changing a driver profile can take over a minute to load. If there are two things requiring a redesign, it would be the shifter and the control screen. The goal obviously should be to reduce the distraction and the precious seconds’ loss with eyes off the road to do basic functions as changing cabin temperature and audio source.

Lease is up next year and already reserved my electric version of the xc40. 
January 2020: still in love with this car. No new concerns or issues. 
Update July 2019: 1 year later and I still love my Volvo. The issues I listed a year ago, while not big issues, remain (except the moonroof screen issue... Volvo was able to correct the problem) and I would love to see them resolved in the next model. Nothing I have found would prevent me from either keeping the model I have or buying the next model. I am an absolute convert to the Volvo brand with this little SUV. 
I have owned Toyotas, Hondas, Fords, Subarus and Chevy's (this is my first Volvo but my 19th vehicle). This is BY FAR my favorite. Let me qualify my review by saying I have no kids and rarely take passengers other than a couple large dogs so wanted an AWD SUV that was compact but did not lack any of the larger SUV perks and got good gas mileage while still having get-up-and-go. This is the only SUV I found that gives you the same options as the larger SUVs (I'm a gadget snob) while still giving you a decent size engine to get you there as quick as you want with good gas mileage (for an SUV). This does every bit of what I was looking for and does it in still. It is truly a fun car to drive and am so happy I got it. The pros FAR FAR FAR FAR outweigh any of the petty first-world issues I have come across, most of which are to be expected on a first-model year vehicle. The only issues I can find are as follows: 
CELL PHONE CHARGING: 1) The wireless charger is pretty useless as there is no ventilation in the compartment so it overheats within minutes, 2) with a larger phone (I have a Note 8) you cannot wirelessly charge the phone and use Android Auto (which requires you to use a cable) as there isn't enough physical space, 3) the port to use Android Auto is not fast charging so if you cannot use the wireless charger while using Android Auto, you essentially cannot charge your phone, 4) the only fast charging port in the vehicle is the USB-C facing the rear seats in the center console; 
LANE KEEP: 1) I find myself ""fighting"" the lane keep assistant as it picks up cracks in the road and is a bit hyper-sensitive at times, even set on the lowest/mildest setting; 
PANORAMIC MOONROOF: 1) uses a multi-function button that can be overly sensitive and opens things you didn't intend, 2) the screen doesn't always close completely, which may be in part due to the multi-function button trying to open the vent end of the moonroof; 
DRIVING MODE SETTINGS: 1) The XC40 allows you to set and save individual driving settings (everything from seats to display appearances and driving preferences) and recognizes the driver by the key fob used but, even with this, you still have to change the driving mode setting every time you get in the car (eco mode, performance, etc) - you would think you could make that a default setting with the others; and, finally 
A/C: 1) other manufacturers have vehicles that do not start air blowing from vents until the air coming out is cool (for A/C) or warm (for heat) but Volvo does not do this so went you turn on the A/C you get outside temp air until the system blows it through and gets to the cool/warm air. 
OVERALL IMPRESSION: I love this SUV and with a few minor tweaks think it could be the perfect car. I look forward to seeing the coming model years and the perfection that is sure to come.
UPDATE  January 2019: After driving the xc40 for 8 months I can say I like it as much or more than when I wrote this. The minor issues still should be improved in future models but it doesn't change my love for this fun and exciting little suv. Can't wait to see this model with the little bugs worked out! "

Ladies -- sick of your purse flying around on the passenger's side while you drive? No worries, there's a hook for that, and more shopping bag hooks in the cargo area to keep bags from rolling around with their contents. The car is nearly silent on your average road. Just the slight hum of acceleration, but there is remarkably little wind or road noise, even on the bumpiest, loudest roads. In fact, people I talk to on the phone joke that they know exactly when I'm maneuvering the car because they can hear things that are normally hidden by the white noise of the engine and road. We found the infotainment system to be very logically designed. It functions very similarly to a smartphone. In fact, the settings quick access buttons on the touchscreen feel very reminiscent of the android pull-down settings menu. After a week, using it feels very natural. My one gripe is that I wish the 360 camera were easier to access quickly. It will appear automatically when it senses I'm parking between two cars, but when I'm pulling into my very tight garage or straight into a parking spot, I have to manually pull it up. Not a big deal -- just takes 2 seconds, but hopefully there will be a shortcut option on future iterations. Auto-park is wonderfully helpful for tight spaces. The upgraded sound system is excellent -- coming from an audiophile. The self-driving features are wonderful for the highway and really serve to reduce fatigue by keeping you in the lane and following the car in front of you at a given distance. We really enjoy the highly customizable driver profiles that can both be programmed to a specific key and overridden through the settings menu. One thing that I found slightly annoying in city traffic was that by default, the auto parking brake enabled at every full stop. This results in a bit of a ""jerking"" when you press the gas pedal, as the brake un-engages and the engine re-starts. I disabled the feature and it doesn't bother me anymore. However, I can certainly see how this feature would be useful for hilly areas where you don't want to roll forward or backwards if you lighten up on the brakes. The back seat has more room than any other car in this class that we test drove. It feels more like a mid-sized SUV in terms of space and seat elevation. After reading a ton of reviews online, I have to say that most reviewers' gripes about this car are really non-issues in the long-run. We specifically looked out for all of the things that were identified as possible cons and haven't actually been able to identify many of them as real cons since we've been driving the car regularly. Bottom line: It's a really solid, well-designed car that's a lot of fun to drive and handle. "

I find the layout of the controls to be very intuitive.  Love the touch screen with simple home button just like a tablet.  It's small with a tight turning radius that makes it easy to maneuver.  The back storage is brilliant with easy ability to subdivide to keep things from rolling around.  It remembers the side mirrors position along with the seat position for each driver.  Didn't think I'd care about it, but like the different driving modes; regularly change it between Comfort, Dynamic and Eco.  I get better than the EPA gas mileage. Oh, and it has a built in trash can.  Seriously, why doesn't every car have that? "

Looked at other brands (Toyota, Honda, Subaru) before deciding I would at least like to see the XC40 in person.  Once I test drove it, I was in love.  It feels good driving it.  I like a boxier body type but this is a little boxy with a punch of style.  I've had mine now for 3 months and not one issue.  I feel it has very good visibility and love the blind spot monitoring.  The back up camera is good quality.  Very good acceleration, shifts smoothly, more than enough power (no issues if I have to punch it) and good storage for the size of the vehicle.  I wasn't after another Highlander so this was a good size for my needs.  So far, I'm averaging 28.5 mpg.  The console tablet I feel was very easy to get used to and use and I'm not the most tech savvy person.   The interior is sleek and simple, and I mean simple in a VERY positive way....it is not busy.  The LED lights are wonderful at night.  I am not a younger driver but do not feel the T5 is not too youthful nor do I feel it is an ""older person's"" looking SUV.  I feel it has a style of it's own and has a classy, fresh look.  I did not opt for navigation so I cannot speak to this.  The ride is very comfortable.  I did not purchase the higher end XC40 but feel I have many, many, options that most brands would not offer unless you went with the top of the trim level line.  Mine is black and a solid color.  Cabin noise is minimal for a 4 cylinder unlike some other brands I test drove.  Takes turns well and seems to hug the curves strongly.  For what this vehicle was designed for, I feel it meets the goal very well.  Very pleased with my purchase! "

I have taken the car to the dealership 3 times (it’s there now) and they still cannot fix the problem—I’m about to pay my first car note on a car that I’ve barely been able to drive. Their excuse is that this is new technology, we’re still learning and we’re looking into it (REALLY)??? Apparently this is a known issue, but Volvo isn’t owning up to it.

Now, a month later, same sensor has failed, I get notifications about the brake system failing, one tire pressure sensor is faulty, and various interior panels keep popping off.

Our goal was to find  a vehicle in the same size (length) as the XTrek with the latest tech/safety features, and the XC40 fits to a T. My biggest disagreement with Edmunds and other reviews is that the Interface/technology screen is NO MORE difficult than learning how to use your new iphone or android/apple ipad.

They really have thought of everything when it comes to storage on this car.  For example, (the Edmunds reviewer missed these little ""Easter Eggs"") under the drivers seat is a discreet tray that slides forward to hid valuables like wallet, phone, checkbook, anything flat.  The tray locks closed so it won't slide out unintentionally and you can't even see it when it's closed.  You have to feel for it.  Also, under the passenger seat is a ""shelf"" that is perfectly sized to hold the owners manual packet.  This means you can free up the entire A/C cooled glove box for anything you want to keep cool.  2.  The headlights are one of my favorite things and a pleasant surprise for how well they perform considering I didn't test drive at night.  They turn with the steering wheel to illuminate any curves you might be heading into.  They also have an auto on/off feature for the high beams.  I live on rural roads, so I use high beams frequently. 
 With one twist of the controls on the stem next to the steering wheel, it activates the high beams.  When there is an oncoming car, the system automatically dims the high beams and then when the other car has passed the high beams come back on automatically.  This even works if you come up behind a car in the same lane you are in.  It is perfectly calibrated so I never have to override the settings.  3.  I like to use the paddle shifters to downshift and save wear on the brakes.  After manually shifting, you can just keep driving in whichever gear you left it in and when the RPM's become unstable for the gear you are driving in it will automatically revert to the correct gear and resume the automatic transmission.  4.  No gas cap!  Just open the gas door, stick the nozzle in, gas up, and shut the gas door when full.  No fumbling with a dirty gas cap.  5.  Rear view mirror.  I don't notice much appreciation for the design of the mirror.  Can you call a rearview mirror sexy?  I just did.  6. The resolution on the cameras, especially on the huge display screen is crisp and beautiful.  The 360 degree camera (uses 4 cameras around the car to give an aerial view including surroundings) is such a cool feature.  There is no excuse to park bad in this car.  I think I'll stop there, but I could go on. "

Likewise, she thinks Volvo has the most ergonomic seats in the world. She has back issues but they are never aggravated driving this vehicle for  both long and short distances.  I concur with her opinions and would add that the XC40’s performance and handling are great.  It’s not a Porsche but the turbo-4 (T5) can move when it’s necessary to pass or break free from a band of pokey drivers. Interior design and quality are pleasing and comfortable. Volvo has always given special attention to safety and minimalist design - it’s a Swedish hallmark that makes Volvo’s unique and dependable.

                   5. Interior and Comfort: The big front seats are roomy and plush. It can have seat ventilation/AC and seat warmer and heated steering wheel, and heated side mirrors. The automatic dual-zone system performed well. Fit and finish are exceptional, and the combination of black nappa leather and suede seat inserts. The seats are supportive beneath and comfortable on long trips. The seats also have plenty of adjustments, including generous fore-aft range and adjustable lumbar / lower-back support. 2 memory buttons allows you to record your favorite positions. It comes in handy when you pick up your car from service only to find out the person driving had changed all your settings. I was a little surprised at the lack of head room. I am by no means a tall individual but with my 5'10"" stature, I have bumped my head in the driver's seat multiple times as I lean forward. I also find myself continuously snagging the panel with my shoes on my left foot when trying to position it on the foot rest in the left front side.

Two adults will be very comfortable in the rear seats. I was able to cross my leg comfortably in the rear seat. There's plenty of knee and feet room. Three adults will fit side by side, but the center seat is rather tight and a very pronounced center tunnel consumes leg and foot room from the person in the middle. 

The rear trunk is surprisingly spacious with automated way to fold the rear seats. All my previous cars have been of the station wagon type of body since I have always been the interstate mover for my three children college moves. I was pleased to see the trunk size. 

6. Technology: This car is loaded with technology too much to list. In addition to all the safety technology features listed above, the car comes with the On call system and Xirius radio for free trial. Once you use these, you probably would like to keep the convenience. Did you know that this car has its own Wi-Fi hotspot? In addition, it has an inductive phone charger so that you can just drop a compatible phone to charge it wirelessly. An app called ""Volvo On Call"" is available for your smart phone where you can perform functions from your phone (lock/unlock doors, start/stop engine). The app also has navigation map that once you found an address you can send it to your vehicle. I was a little disappointed to only find two USB ports. With current day technology, by the time you use one to charge your non inductive phone, one for a USB with MP 3 music, you no longer have a spare for dashcam or a secondary person needing to charge a non-inductive phone.

The XC 40 ride is comfortable but can be a little stiff sometimes. There are several ""Driver Mode"" selectable such as Comfort and Eco but none of those affected the shock absorbers. The noise level is reasonably low and the handling is responsive. While the XC 40 model is by far not the most fuel economical model, the average 23 mpg overall can be a little pricey since the engine requires a premium high octane (98) fuel. However, it is still impressive for such a strong engine.

My biggest gripe with the technology is that the most important contact between the car and the road, which is its tires, does not have the ability to provide continuous tire pressure monitoring system. I am not talking about a TPMS which tells you a tire is low and needs attention, but rather a system which displays tire pressure in PSI of all tires, at all times.


In closing, I did miss the small rubber Swedish flag attached to the car’s left front flank which I saw at Javits Center during a car show but apparently removed from my production line. "

She said that she adored the color combinations of Amazon Blue and white top.  We took it on the road beginning in Atlanta headed for Key West.  The rain poured on our first day and the XC40 performed wonderfully.  The exceleration was not Porsche like, but it did well on the open road of 75 S.  The color that my wife loved so much was enhanced by the waters of Key West.  Women were taking pictures of her car like it was a museum piece or a Louis Vuitton ladies purse.  The oohs and ahhs were contagious.  It wasn't until Naples that I realized the ""Auto-pilot"" feature.  I was able to drive straight from Naples to Atlanta without feeling fatigued.  The XC40 on auto-pilot at 70 mph's held true to the road and let me know all that I needed to know to be safe.  The tracking was incredible.  In closing, I like this car and when I go into the garage, I called her ""Pretty Girl"", my pet name for just about everything that I like.  For me to write about a car like this is a one off, so don't take my words lightly, drive one for yourself. "

562,XC40,2019,4.1, 01/11/2019,Raoul Watson,T5 R-Design 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),51 of 52 people found this review helpful,An awesome compact SUV part 1,4,"This is the first Volvo I have ever owned in my life, my previous car was a 2015 Chevy Impala (see my review on the Impala). I always wanted a Volvo but always was apprehensive due to design and reliability reports from owners. The 2019 XC 40 however, seems to be a very solid crossover/SUV border lining a luxurious car.

1. Appearance: The 2019 Volvo XC 40 is a very handsome looking compact SUV. It is the smallest version of the Volvo SUV and it seems a good crossover for ""SUV beginners"" like me. I like the fact that it is not too tall which would make entry a challenge.
Everything on the outside points to a very well thought off design. I was a little surprised that the placement of the side mirror on the side door is not a little bit further to the front. Because of this further back placement, when the driver looks at the side view mirror, there is a gap between the vehicle body and the mirror, which to me is a little annoying and takes a little getting used to.

2. Performance: The 2.0 liter turbocharged four cylinder 248-hp engine, 8 speed auto transmission is impressive. Just a little push on the gas and it goes from zero to sixty in about 7 seconds. The handling is nimble and almost sporty. The powertrain is quick and responsive but it has an annoying start and stop system. As with most newer cars, when you stop, the XC 40 idles the engine completely down to a point that the engine is shut off. This system would cause an abrupt jerking when restarting. The SUV would lurch forward when starting up from a stop light. It takes a while getting used to but I found out that it is better to release the brakes and wait two second before applying acceleration to avoid the lurching.

3. Safety: The XC 40 is loaded with the safety features found in luxury cars and as always, Volvo is synonymous with safety. ABS, traction, and stability control comes standard along with Volvo's City Safety package. This includes automatic emergency braking along with sensors to detect other vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and other city perils in the vehicle’s path. It includes adaptive cruise control; forward collision warning; lane departure warning; blind spot warning (on the side mirrors); and rear cross-traffic alert making it the most complete crash avoidance system you can get. The optional Pilot Assist / driver assistance system is impressive. I tested it one evening and found that the system has good judgement identifying lane markings and responding to vehicles surrounding us. As a pilot I am not a stranger in trusting an ""autopilot"" system but with a car, because of the visualization interpretation, I would not be very comfortable trusting it 100%. For example, in NY the presence of highway construction means lanes are repainted so multiple crossing lanes would just confuse the pilot assist. So I would use it only on long distance good quality highways. The adaptive cruise control is convenient. It slows the vehicle during traffic slowdowns, and even stop the car to resume progress all on its own. With the addition of daylight running light of beautiful LEDs, all these safety features will give you a handsome insurance discount.

4. Ergonomics: In this department Volvo did not fare very well in my opinion. The human interface of the controls of this car is not always logical. For starters, the gear/transmission shifter it's horrible. It requires a two-step action. For example, to engage reverse or drive, one must move the gear selector twice; one to the back, then in the appropriate direction to select drive or reverse. This is extremely annoying during parking maneuvers and is very frustrating. Of course the argument could be that I should use the automated parking assistance but the shifter is just very unnatural for drivers. While you can operate almost every control from the steering wheel and the voice recognition is a nice addition, the central control screen is extremely convoluted and requires a high degree of learning curve. Coming from Volvo, particularly because it sees itself as a safety brand, the central control screen is just unsafe because it is almost impossible to operate safely while driving. There are too many unintuitive multiple taps, swipes and scrolls necessary to navigate the system. In addition, the system is awfully slow to respond. For example, changing a driver profile can take over a minute to load. If there are two things requiring a redesign, it would be the shifter and the control screen. The goal obviously should be to reduce the distraction and the precious seconds’ loss with eyes off the road to do basic functions as changing cabin temperature and audio source.

Lease is up next year and already reserved my electric version of the xc40. 
January 2020: still in love with this car. No new concerns or issues. 
Update July 2019: 1 year later and I still love my Volvo. The issues I listed a year ago, while not big issues, remain (except the moonroof screen issue... Volvo was able to correct the problem) and I would love to see them resolved in the next model. Nothing I have found would prevent me from either keeping the model I have or buying the next model. I am an absolute convert to the Volvo brand with this little SUV. 
I have owned Toyotas, Hondas, Fords, Subarus and Chevy's (this is my first Volvo but my 19th vehicle). This is BY FAR my favorite. Let me qualify my review by saying I have no kids and rarely take passengers other than a couple large dogs so wanted an AWD SUV that was compact but did not lack any of the larger SUV perks and got good gas mileage while still having get-up-and-go. This is the only SUV I found that gives you the same options as the larger SUVs (I'm a gadget snob) while still giving you a decent size engine to get you there as quick as you want with good gas mileage (for an SUV). This does every bit of what I was looking for and does it in still. It is truly a fun car to drive and am so happy I got it. The pros FAR FAR FAR FAR outweigh any of the petty first-world issues I have come across, most of which are to be expected on a first-model year vehicle. The only issues I can find are as follows: 
CELL PHONE CHARGING: 1) The wireless charger is pretty useless as there is no ventilation in the compartment so it overheats within minutes, 2) with a larger phone (I have a Note 8) you cannot wirelessly charge the phone and use Android Auto (which requires you to use a cable) as there isn't enough physical space, 3) the port to use Android Auto is not fast charging so if you cannot use the wireless charger while using Android Auto, you essentially cannot charge your phone, 4) the only fast charging port in the vehicle is the USB-C facing the rear seats in the center console; 
LANE KEEP: 1) I find myself ""fighting"" the lane keep assistant as it picks up cracks in the road and is a bit hyper-sensitive at times, even set on the lowest/mildest setting; 
PANORAMIC MOONROOF: 1) uses a multi-function button that can be overly sensitive and opens things you didn't intend, 2) the screen doesn't always close completely, which may be in part due to the multi-function button trying to open the vent end of the moonroof; 
DRIVING MODE SETTINGS: 1) The XC40 allows you to set and save individual driving settings (everything from seats to display appearances and driving preferences) and recognizes the driver by the key fob used but, even with this, you still have to change the driving mode setting every time you get in the car (eco mode, performance, etc) - you would think you could make that a default setting with the others; and, finally 
A/C: 1) other manufacturers have vehicles that do not start air blowing from vents until the air coming out is cool (for A/C) or warm (for heat) but Volvo does not do this so went you turn on the A/C you get outside temp air until the system blows it through and gets to the cool/warm air. 
OVERALL IMPRESSION: I love this SUV and with a few minor tweaks think it could be the perfect car. I look forward to seeing the coming model years and the perfection that is sure to come.
UPDATE  January 2019: After driving the xc40 for 8 months I can say I like it as much or more than when I wrote this. The minor issues still should be improved in future models but it doesn't change my love for this fun and exciting little suv. Can't wait to see this model with the little bugs worked out! "

Ladies -- sick of your purse flying around on the passenger's side while you drive? No worries, there's a hook for that, and more shopping bag hooks in the cargo area to keep bags from rolling around with their contents. The car is nearly silent on your average road. Just the slight hum of acceleration, but there is remarkably little wind or road noise, even on the bumpiest, loudest roads. In fact, people I talk to on the phone joke that they know exactly when I'm maneuvering the car because they can hear things that are normally hidden by the white noise of the engine and road. We found the infotainment system to be very logically designed. It functions very similarly to a smartphone. In fact, the settings quick access buttons on the touchscreen feel very reminiscent of the android pull-down settings menu. After a week, using it feels very natural. My one gripe is that I wish the 360 camera were easier to access quickly. It will appear automatically when it senses I'm parking between two cars, but when I'm pulling into my very tight garage or straight into a parking spot, I have to manually pull it up. Not a big deal -- just takes 2 seconds, but hopefully there will be a shortcut option on future iterations. Auto-park is wonderfully helpful for tight spaces. The upgraded sound system is excellent -- coming from an audiophile. The self-driving features are wonderful for the highway and really serve to reduce fatigue by keeping you in the lane and following the car in front of you at a given distance. We really enjoy the highly customizable driver profiles that can both be programmed to a specific key and overridden through the settings menu. One thing that I found slightly annoying in city traffic was that by default, the auto parking brake enabled at every full stop. This results in a bit of a ""jerking"" when you press the gas pedal, as the brake un-engages and the engine re-starts. I disabled the feature and it doesn't bother me anymore. However, I can certainly see how this feature would be useful for hilly areas where you don't want to roll forward or backwards if you lighten up on the brakes. The back seat has more room than any other car in this class that we test drove. It feels more like a mid-sized SUV in terms of space and seat elevation. After reading a ton of reviews online, I have to say that most reviewers' gripes about this car are really non-issues in the long-run. We specifically looked out for all of the things that were identified as possible cons and haven't actually been able to identify many of them as real cons since we've been driving the car regularly. Bottom line: It's a really solid, well-designed car that's a lot of fun to drive and handle. "

The back storage is brilliant with easy ability to subdivide to keep things from rolling around.  It remembers the side mirrors position along with the seat position for each driver.  Didn't think I'd care about it, but like the different driving modes; regularly change it between Comfort, Dynamic and Eco.  I get better than the EPA gas mileage.

Looked at other brands (Toyota, Honda, Subaru) before deciding I would at least like to see the XC40 in person.  Once I test drove it, I was in love.  It feels good driving it.  I like a boxier body type but this is a little boxy with a punch of style.  I've had mine now for 3 months and not one issue.  I feel it has very good visibility and love the blind spot monitoring.  The back up camera is good quality.  Very good acceleration, shifts smoothly, more than enough power (no issues if I have to punch it) and good storage for the size of the vehicle.  I wasn't after another Highlander so this was a good size for my needs.  So far, I'm averaging 28.5 mpg.  The console tablet I feel was very easy to get used to and use and I'm not the most tech savvy person.   The interior is sleek and simple, and I mean simple in a VERY positive way....it is not busy.  The LED lights are wonderful at night.  I am not a younger driver but do not feel the T5 is not too youthful nor do I feel it is an ""older person's"" looking SUV.  I feel it has a style of it's own and has a classy, fresh look.  I did not opt for navigation so I cannot speak to this.  The ride is very comfortable.  I did not purchase the higher end XC40 but feel I have many, many, options that most brands would not offer unless you went with the top of the trim level line.  Mine is black and a solid color.  Cabin noise is minimal for a 4 cylinder unlike some other brands I test drove.  Takes turns well and seems to hug the curves strongly.  For what this vehicle was designed for, I feel it meets the goal very well.  Very pleased with my purchase! "

They really have thought of everything when it comes to storage on this car.  For example, (the Edmunds reviewer missed these little ""Easter Eggs"") under the drivers seat is a discreet tray that slides forward to hid valuables like wallet, phone, checkbook, anything flat.  The tray locks closed so it won't slide out unintentionally and you can't even see it when it's closed.  You have to feel for it.  Also, under the passenger seat is a ""shelf"" that is perfectly sized to hold the owners manual packet.  This means you can free up the entire A/C cooled glove box for anything you want to keep cool.  2.  The headlights are one of my favorite things and a pleasant surprise for how well they perform considering I didn't test drive at night.  They turn with the steering wheel to illuminate any curves you might be heading into.  They also have an auto on/off feature for the high beams.  I live on rural roads, so I use high beams frequently. 
 With one twist of the controls on the stem next to the steering wheel, it activates the high beams.  When there is an oncoming car, the system automatically dims the high beams and then when the other car has passed the high beams come back on automatically.  This even works if you come up behind a car in the same lane you are in.  It is perfectly calibrated so I never have to override the settings.  3.  I like to use the paddle shifters to downshift and save wear on the brakes.  After manually shifting, you can just keep driving in whichever gear you left it in and when the RPM's become unstable for the gear you are driving in it will automatically revert to the correct gear and resume the automatic transmission.  4.  No gas cap!  Just open the gas door, stick the nozzle in, gas up, and shut the gas door when full.  No fumbling with a dirty gas cap.  5.  Rear view mirror.  I don't notice much appreciation for the design of the mirror.  Can you call a rearview mirror sexy?  I just did.  6. The resolution on the cameras, especially on the huge display screen is crisp and beautiful.  The 360 degree camera (uses 4 cameras around the car to give an aerial view including surroundings) is such a cool feature.  There is no excuse to park bad in this car.  I think I'll stop there, but I could go on. "

The gas mileage indicator increases and decreases at any given time. The engine is also a little noisy. I called about having the car serviced and was told it may be something with the emissions. Either way this should not be happening with a new vehicle. Now I have to wait a whole week before the problem can even be addressed. 😡

This is our 6th Volvo and it is one of the best in quality, ride and handling. My wife absolutely loves this vehicle. She is petite but has no problems getting in and out of the vehicle, finding the best seating position and comfortably driving the vehicle. Likewise, she thinks Volvo has the most ergonomic seats in the world. She has back issues but they are never aggravated driving this vehicle for  both long and short distances.  I concur with her opinions and would add that the XC40’s performance and handling are great.  It’s not a Porsche but the turbo-4 (T5) can move when it’s necessary to pass or break free from a band of pokey drivers. Interior design and quality are pleasing and comfortable. Volvo has always given special attention to safety and minimalist design - it’s a Swedish hallmark that makes Volvo’s unique and dependable.  In short, a good buy if you’re looking for style, dependability and quality performance. "

                   5. Interior and Comfort: The big front seats are roomy and plush. It can have seat ventilation/AC and seat warmer and heated steering wheel, and heated side mirrors. The automatic dual-zone system performed well. Fit and finish are exceptional, and the combination of black nappa leather and suede seat inserts. The seats are supportive beneath and comfortable on long trips. The seats also have plenty of adjustments, including generous fore-aft range and adjustable lumbar / lower-back support. 2 memory buttons allows you to record your favorite positions. It comes in handy when you pick up your car from service only to find out the person driving had changed all your settings. I was a little surprised at the lack of head room. I am by no means a tall individual but with my 5'10"" stature, I have bumped my head in the driver's seat multiple times as I lean forward. I also find myself continuously snagging the panel with my shoes on my left foot when trying to position it on the foot rest in the left front side.

Two adults will be very comfortable in the rear seats. I was able to cross my leg comfortably in the rear seat. There's plenty of knee and feet room. Three adults will fit side by side, but the center seat is rather tight and a very pronounced center tunnel consumes leg and foot room from the person in the middle. 

The rear trunk is surprisingly spacious with automated way to fold the rear seats. All my previous cars have been of the station wagon type of body since I have always been the interstate mover for my three children college moves. I was pleased to see the trunk size. 

6. Technology: This car is loaded with technology too much to list. In addition to all the safety technology features listed above, the car comes with the On call system and Xirius radio for free trial. Once you use these, you probably would like to keep the convenience. Did you know that this car has its own Wi-Fi hotspot? In addition, it has an inductive phone charger so that you can just drop a compatible phone to charge it wirelessly. An app called ""Volvo On Call"" is available for your smart phone where you can perform functions from your phone (lock/unlock doors, start/stop engine). The app also has navigation map that once you found an address you can send it to your vehicle. I was a little disappointed to only find two USB ports. With current day technology, by the time you use one to charge your non inductive phone, one for a USB with MP 3 music, you no longer have a spare for dashcam or a secondary person needing to charge a non-inductive phone.

The XC 40 ride is comfortable but can be a little stiff sometimes. There are several ""Driver Mode"" selectable such as Comfort and Eco but none of those affected the shock absorbers. The noise level is reasonably low and the handling is responsive. While the XC 40 model is by far not the most fuel economical model, the average 23 mpg overall can be a little pricey since the engine requires a premium high octane (98) fuel. However, it is still impressive for such a strong engine.

My biggest gripe with the technology is that the most important contact between the car and the road, which is its tires, does not have the ability to provide continuous tire pressure monitoring system. I am not talking about a TPMS which tells you a tire is low and needs attention, but rather a system which displays tire pressure in PSI of all tires, at all times.


In closing, I did miss the small rubber Swedish flag attached to the car’s left front flank which I saw at Javits Center during a car show but apparently removed from my production line. "

Our Jeep was 11 yrs old and it was time to replace it. We liked the XC90, but felt a little guilty about it since we live in the city and didn’t really need all that space 99% of the time. If we did, it would be for a long road trip and then we wouldn’t want that mileage on our car anyway. The XC60 was nice, but we really clicked with the XC40 because unlike other companies, the XC40 doesn’t feel any less nice than the 60, just more compact. It doesn’t have as many features, but it wasn’t anything we needed.

Driving -  It drives more like a GTI (very sporty) but a lot less bumpy. Roads in Brooklyn can be really beat up. Initially when we saw a pothole, we’d cringe waiting for the bump to jostle us (as it did in the GTI) but it feels somehow very smooth and still stiff and connected to the road. We got the Polestar too and it just adds a little more sportiness without sacrifice and with the additional torque in the mid-range. We really love it, more so than the 3 series even, and my wife and I are now constantly arguing who’s turn it is to drive. 

Safety - All cars are not created equal and the safety in this car is incredible. You have to realize that Volvo prioritizes safety beyond requirements and other manufacturers, and if you research it you’ll see that they do not skimp on anything. In government crash testing, the front passenger is not treated to the same scrutiny as the driver, but Volvo ensures it is as safe as can be. City safety is also incredible and with bikers, pedestrians, cabs, etc. it really gives us a piece of mind.

Technology - Volvo uses a tablet-like setup. I do wish it had a few more physical buttons for the climate control. However, despite the learning curve, we found the infotainment to be relatively easy to use after a few days. After that initial learning curve, you realize that you have an ability to really customize a lot and we really like it. I rated it 4 stars because of that initial learning curve, but it’s not far off from being great.

Features - First thing you notice is that Volvo put thought into everything from the materials, to storage and the designs. Feels like a much more expensive car. The panoramic moonroof, the materials, seat cushion extensions, 8 way front seats (both!) and lighting options are just scratching the surface. I also love that with the two keys we use, the car knows when it’s me or my wife and remembers our preferences for the seat, mirrors, and more.

Comfort - The front seats are great and the seat cushion extension is great for my 6’ 2” frame. The backseat is good, but it is a small car and that’s probably where I find it a little lacking as it is a fixed seat and a little short for someone 6’2” (then again, I’m rarely in the back). I really wish you could move or recline the seat. Not a deal breaker, but would be nice.

The look - We love the R-design look for its sporty yet elegant look. The 19” wheels look fantastic and the gray with blue tinge exterior (new color) against the black top make it eye-catching against the boring crowd. People always stare at it and the first time we parked it after the dealership someone made a comment about it being a beautiful car. It’s definitely a head turner. On the inside, I do wish we could opt for lighter cabin materials, which you cannot do in the R-design, but we overlook it because of the huge moonroof, great seats and plenty of light in the spacious cabin.

Overall - We’d highly recommend this car if you’re looking for something practical and sporty with great features, storage and the right amount of luxury. The price can tick up quickly, but nothing else checks almost all the boxes in such a wonderful package that gets you excited to drive it every time while knowing you’re safe. We’re very happy. "

As background, I traded in a five year old XC60.  I was looking for something with all the safety features and tech, a little smaller, with better gas mileage, and the XC40 fit the bill.  The car is zippy and I recently got 27 mpg in the city.  The touchscreen interface is easy to learn, and has some cute features available.  The drive is smooth overall.  The automatic breaking when you back up in crowded parking lots really works well (ha!) and I've always loved the parking assist sensors, rain sensors, BLIS, etc. on the Volvos.  The front is small, but the center console, dashboard and steering wheel are positioned for room to stretch a little bit, which is nice.

One of the things I dislike about XC40 is the blind spots in the rear of the vehicle.  The third pillar is too wide and it's unsettling not being able to see cars approaching, even with the BLIS engaged and mirrors set correctly.  Although there are other car brands/ models that have blind spots like this, it is surprising Volvo allowed that design to pass.  I am guessing it's for strong frame support, but my XC60 had virtually no blind spots so it's a real adjustment.  For some reason, I didn't notice them during the test drive, otherwise I might have rethought my purchase.

Additionally, despite the nifty front seat driver adjustments available, it's really hard to get comfortable in the car for more than an hour's drive.  The rear seats are adequate in size for most humans, but even my kids complain about their backs hurting after awhile.

Overall, a nice vehicle for city driving, but not for long commutes or trips. "

A fantastic program you should explore but that is not part of this review. We drove the car 3000 miles in Sweden and Norway during our trip and are now waiting for the car to be delivered to our dealer in Colorado. During those 3000 miles, the car functioned perfectly. All systems no problems. The car is reasonably quiet. Very responsive. Interior appointments are luxury level in my view since I am moving up from a Subaru Forester 2014, and the little touches to details are excellent. The bag hug on the glove box, the many little cubbies, the drawer under the driver's seat, the trash basket in the center armrest is the best.
Storage behind the back seat is smaller than in the Subaru but very adequate. The way the area is configured in our model is perfect. There are several configuration options and you need to look at Volvo's site to check it out. You will love it. We got over 30 miles to the gallon (US) of gas and that was fine for me. Seats are very comfortable both front and back. The computer is similar to the one in Tesla in terms of the screen and a computer like operation style. Once I adjusted I started to get more comfortable with it. The safety features are numerous and I still need to learn more but the parking assist, the highway driving assistant, and the 360-degree camera are super. We are very pleased with the car and it is certainly a major upgrade from our Subaru which we also enjoyed.

After complaining to Volvo, they offered to look at it.. after about $1500 in repairs, noting offering to change my oil trap (which i told them was already repaired and paid for), they said they did some necessary computer adjustments, and I must also purchase a new dipstick for the oil??? Didn't know why I would need a new dipstick??

That being the case, when similarly equipped, the price difference and fuel consumption between the 3.2 and the T6 are not that great. Given other comments I've seen this was a wise choice.

Aside from scheduled maintenance  volvo has either repaired or replaced under warranty the following: Battery twice ( car had to be towed in both times), plastic piece by rear seat headrest broke, plastic piece by rear seat fold down lever broke, AC condenser, gas gauge sending and receiving unit, rear back up camera, dash computer,rear hatch actuator,   Windshield was leaking water inside, has now developed a bad smell they believe is mildew caused by water getting under carpet from leaking windshield so they shampooed carpet, car still smells.  Based on repair history of first 5 yrs of ownership the time when the least repairs should occur it is obvious the car has issues. Now that warranty is up I contacted volvo explaining that I didn't think it fair that I find myself in a position that I pay $43000 for a car, maintain it well, has less than 50,000 miles and it appears I must sell it to avoid hefty future repairs. I asked them to  recognize that this is not their best manufactured vehicle and must be outside of what they believe is acceptable. I asked they either preferably  extend the warranty or if not provide a very good incentive to trade in on a newer volvo.  Their first response was to tell me that if any of the repairs made broke a second time they would ""consider"" at that time making the repair.  I asked to speak to the person making that decision so we could discuss and was told I cannot.  I wrote another letter to volvo a bit stronger and low and behold I received a call from the servicing dealer (Jaguar Land Rover Porsche Volvo of Greenville).   I went in and  met contact at dealer.  He looked at history and told me the following:  The car was out of service 28 days in the 5 yrs, it had been in 11 times for service in 5 yrs,  (This doesn't seem too bad however when something broke we lived with it until it was time for next scheduled service as we live about 40 min drive from dealer.)  Had I had to pay for those repairs it would have cost me approx $5000.  My feeling was that $5000 for repairs in the first 5 yrs was horrible this is when car should need to be repaired the least.  He then told me that bringing it in 11 times in 5 yrs was below average.  When I told him that Volvo cannot be proud of the repair history of this car and cannot think it is usual and customary he said that two of the repairs added to $2600 and if we separated out those two repairs the repairs history of $2400 was pretty good. While this is all going on they price my car for a trade in and give me a price of $11,000 that would be a 75% depreciation in 5 yrs  for a vehicle with no visible damage inside or out with less than 50,000 miles (kbb prices median trade in as $14,000). End result is volvo obviously feels and dealer rep has expressed to me that these repairs are normal and within acceptable limits I obviously disagree.  Also be aware that while volvo is responsive to emails you cannot speak directly with a decision maker they are shielded..Very frustrating.. "

Cons: durability probably doesn't measure up to vintage Volvos; at 65k miles we've got intermittent noises from the blower motor and alternator, and every bump is registered with a muted ""tick"" from the cargo cover and door panels. Same deal with the seats: while they're still probably better than anyone else's, they're not as comfy as those in, say, an old 850.  Pro-and-con: the straight-six engine. It's tuned for low-end torque so it's an absolute beast from 0-30 but then runs out of steam quickly...so the Stoplight Grand Prix is amusing but highway merging and passing are just acceptable; similarly, city MPG is frankly dismal, while highway MPG is surprisingly good.

Little did I know this model/year is prone to an oil leak internally. You have to get your hands on TJ24643. It will describe the low oil level warning and how Volvo engineers fix (hide) the leak warning. Here is their thinking: Let's re-program the computer to alert at a lower oil level, then let's change out the dipstick with a longer one and move the Full/Low markings lower on the dipstick!! If the warning comes back after that, you have to haggle for a new engine.....So other than that, the car is a blast!! "

We drove through Sweden and Norway.  The handling on the very narrow and winding roads through the Norwegian Fjords was awesome.  The steaming coffee cup warning telling me I seemed tired and should stop for coffee to rest only came up once on those crazy winding roads.  The car thought I was sleepy and gave me a warning!  That car has great acceleration for heavy metropolitan traffic.  It is so comfortable to sit in and passengers are likewise comfortable.  The only complaint I have is that it could be quieter in the car.  The road noise is a little louder than I'd like, but not nearly as loud as in my past cars.  Other than replacing tires and a couple of batteries we have had no major repairs yet.  We do stay on top of our maintenance and get that done exactly on time.  We just let go of a 2004 Volvo S60 that we had for its entire ""life"" and it still ran great.  Maintenance is the key.  As far as the safety equipment, blis, etc. it works terrific and yes, it will throw on the brakes when needed.  You do have to be sure that the outside sensors are clear of bugs or you might find yourself driving to a high pitched alert alarm without being able to turn it off.  I had this happen and it was just a bug that splatted right smack on the sensor at the front grill.  The car was sure I was about to run into something (all the way home) and it kept trying to tell me!  I could not be happier with my XC60.  We just got back from Europe where we picked up our second OSD, the all-new XC40.  What a sweet car!  I love my Volvos.  I highly recommend the XC60.  It has served me very well all these years and I would pick it again and again! "

I love how fast the car drives however, I've owned the car for 6 months and its been in the shop 4x since. There was an issue with the alignment but that was resolved (I had to take it to the dealer because when I took it to firestone 2x in 2 different states the car still didn't drive straight). I then had a problem where the car would not read most of my audio files on my usb, and then if there was a whole folder that it couldn't read it would completely stop working and I needed to stop the car and turn it off and on, (sometimes that didn't resolve the issue) that issue came back 2 more times since. I've had to replace the rotors twice already. It's almost as if they make them out of plastic. I had replace them because they warped, it made the steering wheel shake violently when I went 45 mph or faster. The car is a very rough ride, so if you have back issues I would look at something else. I drove for 11 hours and by the time we got to our destination it felt like somebody took a baseball bat to my back. I was looking for a reliable AWD vehicle because I live where there is a ton of snow and ice, also the closest Volvo shop is 4 hours away so I can't exactly pop in if I have an issue. This car is not that! I don't hate everything about the car, I love how stable it is at high speeds. I live where the speed limits are 80 mph and with this car passing is no issue. When you put your foot to the floor, the car goes into cheetah mode and takes off. Its AWD system is not the best, with its 60(front)/40(back) split. My sister has an 2013 Outback and that cars AWD system is a lot better than the Volvo's, hands down. The BLIS package has some issues, it gives you false readings quiet often, that being said it saved me a few times. I have LED headlights that have the active bending feature which helps when driving at night through passes. I like this cars parking sensors, they've saved me countless times. I get 17-18 mpg around town, and 19-20 mpg on the highway however, I do have a heavy foot. I can deal with most of the issues this car has but, the rotors anger me every time I think about them. So the question is would I buy this car if I knew everything I know now? My answer most likely would be no. My reasoning is mainly that the rotors are expensive and putting down that much money so often is problematic. Not mentioning how much time this takes, last time it took the dealership 5 days to replace them. So if you are a fan of back pain, and you have money to waste, and you have all the time in the world this car is the perfect car for you! I think next time I would rather buy a V6 Subaru Outback! "

The configurable dash is cool at first, but eventually you find one of three  choices you really like and stick with it. The center stack is a bit over populated, but you get used to it, and once you locate what you need all subsequent operations are logical. The engine is sweet, and I mean SWEET. Zero turbo lag....max torque is ready and willing anywhere in the rev range. Couple that plant-you-in-your-seat acceleration with fabulous seats, and you've got an hours-on-end cruiser that is unequaled. Or a refined city errand-runner.

**UPDATE**  3-20-2016  Had the good fortune to road-trip with the Volvo. What a great highway cruiser. Power when you need it, suspension soaking up all those nasty road imperfections, and a whopping great stereo. A clear winner vs the Lexus.
**UPDATE** 9-21-2016 The T6 continues to impress. A summer full of highway construction has not deterred this black beauty from traveling anywhere, anytime. It is the perfect blend of utility vehicle and sporting machine. The twin-scroll turbo puts power on your foot RIGHT NOW and smoothly pulls all the way up to speed. Need to pass at freeway speeds? Once again that twin-scroll turbo launches you past the unsuspecting. I know it's an SUV, but this really is a great car.

September 2017 
Still in love with the Volvo. Tires are ready to be replaced at 22k. The dealer wants to perform an alignment along with a top tier  price, so we looked elsewhere and the $1400 Dealer price is down to $988 without an alignment. The car doesn't need it as it tracks true as the day it rolled off the assembly line.  Everything works as it should. The styling is still crisp and fresh. This is one well-designed mode of transportation!
March 2018
Volvo keeps sending us sales stuff to get us to come look at the new XC60... Why? This is a great all-around car. Winter snow? No problem! Our only complaint is how hard it is to keep the car clean!
Sept 2018 Zoomed past 30k. This car is tight, quick, comfortable and roomy. Recently rented a 2018 XC90 and was not impressed...will be keeping the XC60 with it's fabulous engine, perfect transmission and great brakes.
Sept 2019   Four and a half years in and this car rewards you each time you press the starter button.  Had the unfortunate rear-ended-by-a-dummy that required some minor body work so we had the body shop refresh the paint... it looks showroom new. WOW. Everything still works as it should. Engine, tranny and brakes are a harmonious unit that perform so well together I can't believe they discontinued this engine. 
Our dealer experience has tempered our enthusiasm. Every visit for a fix has required a minimum of two trips. Regular maintenance is never an issue. For example, we got a warning message the Volvo on Call needed updating. We never signed up for or used the service. Contacted the service and the car would not stop redialing the service! First dealer visit they  told us they removed the feature.....only to have the message pop up about two weeks later. Second dealer visit seemed to be fixed only to have a front warning message upon pickup.... back for third visit.......seems they don't know how to properly close the hood when delivering cars. Sigh. 
The only other negative is the driver side leather is wearing much faster than other cars we have at similar ages and similar usage. We regularly treat our leather interiors so it has not been neglected...the leather is just a bit on the thin side.Other than that, this car rocks! We are confident it will be in our garage for 10+ years.
**March 2020** Found a new dealer who did our 40k service. They are twice as far as the other dealer but well worth the drive. The car is just humming along. No mechanical hiccups. Just pleasant, reliable motoring week after week. I would not hesitate to buy one of these used. Coming out of a mild winter, it still looks showroom new. What a great car! "

The oil issue went away.  After the first oil change it seemed to stop burning oil, a good thing.  Gas mileage has not increased.  It still averages about 27 on the highway and less in town, maybe a 24 mpg average,  less than we expected.

The user interface still confuses my wife, it is not very intuitive.  

The car does drive nice and has good performance, by far its best point.  

Another issue is oil changes.  Volvo has told us due ""they"" need to put it on the computer to do an oil change,  Jiffy-lube or Firestone, etc should not do it.  I still have yet to verify that.

We have found the Volvo dealer no better than the local Chevy dealer, we make appointments and they lose them or tell us when we bring it in its first come first serve.  My wife refuses to take the car in for service due to she is frustrated with the dealer.

So the bottom line after two years would I recommend it, probably not.  I have a 2014 Chevy equinox AWD and a 2011 Honda CRV, the Volvo  is  nicer to drive, but  issues,  such as Volvo states they need to  do oil changes, MPG falls short, the blue-tooth/entertainment system is years behind the others.  I was afraid to buy Chevy but all five drivers in my family except for my wife like it the best.  

So in my opinion for the price  the Equinox or CRV are a better buy.  


First write up.
First off I would say this is the best driving car we have ever had.  It handles very well, has better than average acceleration, stops well, steers well, etc.  The interior is nice, our only complaint is the “storage area” under the radio, you can’t really put anything in it or it falls out when you turn.  The seats are comfortable, and cargo space is adequate.  

Our big complaint is gas mileage.  The T-5 Drive E engine should get 24 in town and about 30 on the highway.  We rarely average over 23 mpg. On our Honda CRV and Chevy Equinox we always meet or exceed the EPA estimated MPG, so I don’t think it our driving habits.  Either Volvo over estimated MPG or who knows. 
 
The only other complaint is the information/blue tooth system is not very intuitive.  The local Volvo Dealer had to contact other dealers on how to check the oil level from the info system.  The car does not have a dip-stick.  The manual does not describe how to do it  My wife or daughter still can’t check the oil level using the information system.  Checking the oil is much like running  old DOS commands from function keys on your keyboard.  

The engine does need oil added between the 10,000 mile interval oil changes.  Typically at 4000~5000 after an oil change it needs oil.  Volvo thought this would go away after the first oil change, but we had to add oil at the 13,000 mile mark. "

Turning safety features on and off is simple, there are dedicated buttons, and the adjustments and customizing for those features is made using the screen when you're not driving.
I actually bought this for my daughter. I had narrowed it down the Honda/Acura and the Subarus due to their great active safety features, but sprung for the Volvo since it's safer and just nicer in a lot of ways. 
Interestingly, you'll find the Subaru scores higher on active braking because it triggers auto braking earlier and stops you completely when approaching a car at 25mph. With this Volvo, you'd still hit the car, but at a slow speed.  What the IIHS testing doesn't tell you when it compares these systems, is that Volvo uses both radar and a camera. The Subaru uses a camera that can easily be blinded if you are driving into the sun. The Subaru does warn you the collision avoidance system can't ""see"", but the Volvo simply doesn't get blinded. I prefer that. It is also built a bit stronger, and seats you wonderfully. The honda and acura use ""radar"" too, and are very nice for the price. "

While under warranty I had lots of little problems, and the check engine light came on so regularly I ended up having to buy a code checker to avoid constant trips to the dealership or somewhere like autozone to have it read.    One of the reasons it kept going off was the gas tank was visible machined poorly, so no matter how well I attached the cap the check engine light for emissions would come on.  It also burned through oil on a few occasions.  I took it to the dealership immediately, but they couldn't ever find anything wrong.  Other problems were generally small issues like sensors or spark plugs going bad.  These were an inconvenience, but they weren't major and were covered by the warranty so I didn't care too much at the time .  At about 55,000 miles the car suddenly started emitting a very high pitched squeal.  I made plans to take it to the dealership the next morning.  In the morning the check engine light was on, and it also started revving uncontrollably when stopped at stop lights.  Eventually they informed me the bearings in both cam shafts went bad, and the thermostat needed replaced.  This was about a $3000 repair cost, and they said it would take about a week because they had to order the parts.  It took the dealer 7 WEEKS to repair my car.   They seemed incapable of ordering the right parts or ordering all the parts they need.  They did not keep me informed at all, and I constantly had to call and check in.  Half the time they weren't able to provide me a time estimate at all, and they other half of the time they said it would only be another couple days.  I spoke to Volvo corporate, left messages for the manager, etc, all to no avail.  Finally they called and said it would be ready the next day, only for them to discover something else wrong with the car.  When they finally finished all the repairs I picked up the car, and immediately noticed how heavy the steering felt.  I thought it was just because I'd been driving a different loaner vehicle for the past 7 weeks  (Honestly it had been so long I kept reaching for the wrong controls in my car once I got it back).  However, after a couple more days it became clear something is now wrong with the power steering.  Now I have to decide whether to take it back to the same dealership and see if they will fix it for no/reduced cost since it was likely the result of something they did, or take it to a different dealership which might provide better service.  Either way this is definitely my last Volvo ever.  We were thinking about an XC90 for my wife, but now there is no way we'll even consider it.     About the only thing positive I have to say about the car is that it averaged about 28-30mpg for me, but the savings isn't worth the other costs and frustrations. "

Horrible support from Volvo,4,"The XC-60 continues to do very well.  Gas mileage is a bit disappointing.  21 city, 25 hwy.  I had a problem with the auto-stop and it took three visits to a dealer to get it fixed.  Each dealer blamed the other.  It has been working for a month so I hope this is done.

I purchase a 2015.5 XC-60 4 cylinder turbo charged vehicle in February.  The vehicle is great...
Unfortunately, Volvo support is awful.  The XC-60 comes with a print manual of about 200 pages and there is an on-line manual of 400 pages.  Sadly, the manuals are either wrong or incomplete for many of the features.  No mention of multiple dashboards, no mention of setting mpg vs instant mpg, low pressure tire indicator directions are wrong, no mention of how to collapse the back seat.... I could go on.  The arrogance:  I called Volvo and the young woman told me Volvo never changes their manuals once they are printed.  I asked:""even on line"".  No never, for more than $40K: this is customer service?

NEW COMMENT:

My most frustrating current problem is the stop/start system.  I have had to take it back for repair four times and now will take it back for a fifth.  It sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  It has gone out completely twice.  Once they replaced the car battery and the second time they said the dealership didn't reset the system.  

Our newest problem is with the start/stop system.  This will be the 5th time taking it back.  It went out completely in the first year and they replaced the car battery.  It went out six months later and the dealership claimed the tech didn't reset the system.  It is now incremental.  Volvo will tell you (they evidently have this writt



I have two major gripes about our Volvo XC-60:

1.  The back seat is unbelievably uncomfortable.  The backs don't recline at all and is very uncomfortable.  This is unlike our GMC Terrain, where the back seat can be moved back and forth about 10 inches, and the seats can be placed either upright or reclining a bit.

2.  Learning to use the technology requires an extensive amount of time with the manual.... which does not include much of the information you will need.  Setting bluetooth, radio stations, GPS are all several step, complex processes.  WHY?

New Comment, April 2019.  

The stop/start system doesn't work at all.  Finally, the dealership admitted that the computer is set so that no matter the battery charge the stop/start system won't work.  Tried another new battery and Volvo can't reset the computer to kick in when it should.  You would need a constant 15 volt battery for the system to work.

At 30K miles, we had to have the rear brakes replaced.  It was only discs and the charge was over $500.  My local shop won't touch cars with electronic parking brake.  Another major repair and we revert to Acura or Lexus. "

However, I really love the look and feel of the XC60.  I wanted a T6, but our local mechanic recommended the T5.  He thought the T5 has fewer issues.  So far, so good.  It’s a really great combination of luxury and safety features.  The leather seats have that nice “real leather” smell.  I absolutely love driving it.  I’ve been using the sport shift a lot, which is fun.  I miss my manual V5”, but this is such an amazing upgrade.  I have no complaints about the pickup.  I haven’t noticed a throttle lag.  Based on my research on reliability, we payed extra to get an extended warranty to 100k.  I’ve never done that before, but just don’t want to risk it.  Now were thinking about some accessories like a roof rack and possibly a toe hitch.  Fingers crossed about future ownership, but we are loving it so far.  Also love the Harmon Kardon sound.

The SUV is overall very safe im sure but the accessibility of the backseat is ridiculous. I cannot tell you how many times ive hit my head trying to maneuver my sons car seat into the middle seat. The only way you can easily get a car seat in the backseat is if you move either the driver seat or the passenger seat forward almost completely. My husband is 6'1"" so if he is driving you may as well count the driver side of the car out in terms of being able to put a baby into the back.  For the amount of money we paid for the vehicle i assumed the backseat would be comfortable which it is not for an adult. I am only 5'4"" and am incredibly uncomfortable when i sit in the backseat with my son, to the point where you have to sit sideways because your legs have practically no room. I feel this is a HUGE design flaw on Volvo's part! If you only have 1 child and don't count on having any more then this is the car for you. However if you plan on having more kids good luck to them being comfortable in the back seat! I cannot wait until it is time to buy a new vehicle which is unfortunate because I heard such great things about Volvo's but probably will never buy another one again! "

This is our 4th Volvo since 1990. The other 3 were wagons (a 240 and 2 V70s).  The last one we bought now is about 12 years old with over 220K miles; until this past month it has required little more than routine maintenance but now it is starting to show its age.  Good price incentives in July encouraged me to buy new.  I chose the XC60 over another 70 series mostly for the styling and extra ground clearance in the XC60, and because cargo capacity isn't as big a priority for us anymore. The XC60 is a very comfortable car with supportive front seats and enough leg, shoulder and head room for my above average male body size. The drive-e engine delivers surprisingly good fuel economy for a car this heavy, yet acceleration also is more than adequate for my needs. The leather seats are beautiful, although I would have preferred the cloth upholstery that has held up so well in my old V70 for 12 years.  Another thing I miss is the fold-flat front passenger seat in the V70, which allowed me occasionally to carry long items such as lumber (but then, I wouldn't want to do that in a car this nice). The infotainment system keeps me entertained and informed with more choices than I really need. It's a little more complicated than I would have preferred and I'm afraid it will seem dated within a few years. The ""premier"" version is nicely equipped as-is, without adding expensive options.  If you're comparing alternatives, Subaru is another (less expensive) make I'd consider, especially if you want AWD. Volvo prices seem to run lower than you'd pay for most Lexus, Audi, BMW or Mercedes models (unless you get into the bigger, more expensive 90 series, which would've been more than we need). "

I drive 160 miles a day, mostly on interstate.  The XC60 is great on the highway: Smooth, fast enough, quiet, stable, and big enough to inspire confidence.  I get about 28 MPG on the highway using regular gas.  I generally cruise between 75 and 80 mph, and the XC60 is a fun, satisfying, soothing car to get home in.

And while it’s not a sports car, the XC60 is also fun and comfortable on twisty back roads.  It’s small enough to feel nimble and pointable—not at all trucky.  I can’t compare it to an X3 or Q5, but it compares favorably to my previous Mazda3, especially given the Volvo’s different mission in life. Good steering feel, balance, grip, and braking.

The seats are great once you get them right.  That took some doing but now I have a great position saved in memory.  The leather and other materials seem nice now, but a year-old used one I looked at had not held up well.  It had done time in New Mexico—I’m hoping the heat was a factor.

The only feature I would change is the start-stop system.  It’s an interesting idea and sometimes works well, but more often is an annoyance.  It should be permanently defeatable, instead of having to be turned off every time.  I also think a back-up camera should be standard, especially from a company known for safety.  And it’s a little more rattly than the Japanese cars I’ve owned, but I kind of expected that.

Overall this is a great car for me right now.  Comfortable, classy, fuel-efficient, satisfying to drive, and, as long as it’s reliable, I’m looking forward to my three daughters using up whatever’s left of it when I’m done. "

THE BAD: Fuel economy not on par with EPA (c/h/m 22/29/24 vs reality 20/24.5/21.3), no ventilated seats available, no sync button for dual zone climate control, short-life wipers, cumbersome and un-intuitive infotainment system, intrusive start/stop system, torque steer and frequent tire spinning with FWD (AWD offers much better handling especially at full throttle from standstill), two stage door opening when locked, some door panel and city safety device rattle. THE UGLY: Raspy and unrefined 4 cylinder engine (especially at higher RPMs where the engine sounds like a turbo-diesel), engine clatter at idle, ordinary ride quality not on par with a premium crossover, clunky transmission, odd lurches from a standstill and sometimes at parking lot speeds.  THE VEREDICT: A good value proposition, well planned with the need of some fine tunning in a competitive market segment.

It's not perfect but it is very much nothing to complain about. I love the interior tech. The Platinum package is the way to go. You can do R-Design Platinum but the version is simple a few bells here and there, essentially it's the same car. The Navigation can be a bit more intuitive but as of 2018 model, that's all done and over with. This is simply all about the ""up to 2017"" models.

It's my wife's driver and she's very happy with it. This car is way too rough on bumps etc. My 37K new Honda Pilot is a plush ride comparatively. The XC is peppy and really kicks it, but I'm very disappointed with the joltiness of the ride.  The tech package is OK, but lacks walk away locking and you pay a monthly extra for remote start. The driver/passenger heat/ac lacks synching which has become fairly common.

12/20/17  We've had no problems with the vehicle.  Remain irritated with their stingy control over remote start.  It's $499 if you want it added to the car.  MPG is not impressive at about 17 around town.  The 2018 XC60 is tempting, but our next will probably be an all electric from?

12/20/2019 We became tired of the cramped feeling in the car. I did pay extra for the remote start which was worth the money. At 30K miles they wanted $500 to redo the back brakes and I'd had enough. We lost 50% of the value. I tried to get Mrs to switch to Honda, but no. Purchased the 2019 XC60. It's roomier with some better features, however the remote start add-on is not available. After 4 years of free remote mobile phone start, you have to pay. This is a good scheme to sell you a new Volvo.  I hope by then my Mrs will be ready to leave Volvo. "

Volvo has been around for decades and have been setting the safety standard for years. Not only are volvos safe, but there also comfortable, stylish/perform well, dependable, and affordable. I am a very picky person when it comes to cars and it takes a lot for me to consider a car. When I look at buying a car I look at the overall styling of it, if it is comfortable or not, if it is dependable, but above all I look at how safe it is and in my opinion volvo blows all of these categories out of proportion.
SAFETY- As I said before Volvo has been setting the safety standard for years; they have come out with everything from the three point seat belt or pedestrian detection with full auto brake to auto pilot system on cars. Volvo cares deeply about the safety of their buyers and unlike other car brands that put luxury first or convenience they put safety first. All Volvos come standard with a pre-collision system called city safety. In my opinion volvo cars are the safest cars on the road today.
COMFORTABLE- Volvo also cares about how comfortable its passengers are. Volvo has gone as far to have special seats designed by orthopedic surgeons to make the ride of a volvo more comfortable. They use very nice soft to the touch materials in their cars that its passenger appreciate.
STYLING AND PERFORMANCE- Volvo has sleek designs that set them apart from other auto maker from there Thor Hammer headlights to their distinctive long LED taillights. When you see a Volvo on the road (especially the new ones) you can tell it's a Volvo because of the sleek styling of it.I think that Volvo does a great job of making their cars head turners. For years Volvo did an ok job in the performance, but in the last decade they have really been improving the performance of their cars. All their cars come standard with turbocharge engines, but for those who want a little more of a driving experience like me, you can get a special line of Volvo called the R-Design. The R-designs come with special turbo engines tuned by the Swedish racing company Polestar (Polestar also tunes the suspension of the car). I own a Volvo XC60 R-Design which is a crossover and it feels like I’m driving a sports car like the Lexus IS or BMW 3 Series.
Dependability- Volvos are very reliable I have never had a major issue with mine and neither have my family members who have one. There a little more expensive to work on but they’re worth it.
AFFORDABILITY- Volvos have a long range of price tags, but for what they are there very reasonably priced. There prices range from lower $30,000-well over $90,000 in the U.S., but you can get a year old volvo in the 20's. "

I started looking for vehicles Summer 2018, test drove 3 cars, but they were all Dark Blue and had more miles and more dings, scratches, etc. One had low miles, but a long of dings on the passenger side of the vehicle.  Still putting it off after my work started, I was determined to find a car over Thanksgiving break.  There were two vehicles that caught my eye. I went to look at one on Sunday and sent in an internet interest request. I got a call on Monday, let them know that I would be there Wed. at 1 p.m. (appointment).  By the time I got there, they had sold the vehicle at 11 a.m. or so.  The internet contact let me know someone was taking the car for a test drive at 10 a.m. or so. That was a 2017 model with 21,000 miles.  So, after that did not go well, I began re-searching and looking at my next choice, which was a low mileage 2016 model.

Whether the problem is in the head or the cylinder is not clear, but the Volvo dealer is quoting me a new engine at $17k (note: the book value of the car is $16k). So logically we asked Volvo USA to review our case and, ideally, help us out somehow. Isn’t that reasonable? They flatly denied us, it took them all of one day to decide, so I guess we weren’t even close. Can you believe that? The car was taken care of, and the service records prove that, and their product failed us ... massively. What kind of company would leave us 100% on the hook like that? I’m sure these things happen now and then, but not to us, and not so massively, and not a couple month out of warranty, and not without the mfg showing some degree of concern.

I bought it after having my 2011 VW Touareg TDI bought back after the whole Dieselgate situation about a year and a half ago. My old car had some pretty significant reliability issues, and having this car consistently perform without any issues or unexpected problems has been a breath of fresh air. Specifically, the car is a great long distance cruiser - set it on cruise control at around 70 MPH and it will easily achieve 30 MPG on regular fuel. Compared to the vehicles I was cross shopping, the comparably low cost of ownership/operation ultimately made the decision easy for me. I test drove BMWs, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi products but all of them had questionable reliability and operating costs that were, in my opinion, not worth the extra effort and cost. The front seats are exceptionally comfortable, but being a taller and frankly larger driver, the rear seat legroom behind my seating position is not as generous as it would be in some larger competitors. I have had the car serviced once, and only two other visits to the dealership to have the coolant levels topped off and a styling accessory installed. I do have to say that after about 18 months of ownership, my only complaint has been a seemingly sharp decline in resale value, and jealousy looking at the newer XC60s, but I plan on holding on to this car for quite a while and the potential for high-mileage and long-term ownership has kept me driving my car.

First, the power lock on the driver side door decided not to function one day, but hasn't repeated yet.  During a heavy rain, the auto folding mirrors would not fold back out after turning the car on and off several times. It later reset after being parked for an hour and I was told by the dealer to push the left and right mirror command buttons at the same time which should cause the mirrors to fold out if they are stuck. Best of all, I believe the parking break malfunctioned, triggering the check engine light to come on and the car to be undriveable. After I safely rolled into a parking lot and turned the care off and on it appears to be fixed for the time being. I'll be making my first trip to the service department before I make my second car payment!  There are some good things: Acceleration is great for a 4 cylinder and size of the car; Tons of cargo space + panoramic sun roof made for some luxury car camping; Very comfortable (and great gas mileage at about 30 mpg) on a 8 hour road trip; Bluetooth integration is fairly seamless (wishing the car had apple play) and the navigation system has a very nice feature where the next turn displays in the instrument panel so you don't have to keep looking back at the screen.

Don't need to fold passenger seat often but, when needed this is a major fail.  Had '93 850 GLT with passenger that seat folded flat, standard equipment.

Whoever designed the interface for the infotainment system had his head up his rectum; not intuitive or user friendly.  Power seat memory buttons need to be held depressed to move the seat; should follow the lead of other manufacturers and use a momentary contact switch to move the driver's seat.

I test drove the Mercedes Benz GLC 300, Audi Q5, Jaguar F-Pace, Mazda CX-9 (X3 2018 was not available to test drive) and at the end the Volvo was the winner. To me, the design of the Volvo is the most modern and elegant of the bunch. The engine on the T5 is on par with the Base models of the other brands. (@250HP and around the same torque) The cabin set up for convenience of the driver, the blend of technology and amenities on a simple yet elegant design made the XC60 the best. I was a little concerned with the performance and almost decided to go with the T6 but I honestly could not justify the extra money, the engine performs just fine for the type of driving I do. The noise levels at highway speeds are just right, not so quiet that you fall asleep but not so loud that you can't carry a conversation. The R-design specs are certainly  worth the extra cash, the fit and finish of the seats is impeccable. The steering wheel, shifting paddles, aluminum accents, and the overall environment are just way above the German and British competition. One characteristic that I have really liked is the suspension. My only test drive was on a XC90 T5 and on that occasion I noticed some plushness to the suspension, specially when compared t my old BMW 328i. On the R-design suspension that feeling has not been present, it is firm but not uncomfortable it just feels sporty to the point that you forget you are driving a 4000lbs+ SUV. I have never owned a Volvo so the question of reliability and quality long term are still out there. Without a doubt my initial impression to this point has been 100% positive. "

Compared to my former Jeep Grand Cherokee or Ford Explorer, it is much more connected, easy / fun to drive and luxurious feeling inside.  The safety technology and driver Pilot Assist 2 are amazing.

The Audi seats hurt her back so we sold it back to the dealer with less than 2000 miles on it (OUCH!). Inscription has amazing seat adjustments, features and comfort. Terrible window glare off dash during daytime unless drive wears sun glasses. Visibility is good, though the BLIS could have been made more pronounced in the side mirror. No mfg compares to Audi on the BLIS system visibility. The infotainment computer, while billed as working like an iPhone with a home button, is cumbersome, slow and difficult to learn.It takes forever to download updates, and notices of them are very misleading.  Navigation graphics, operation and search results leave a lot to be desired ( I could use a crass word but won't) especially compared to the Q5. Its choices of routes are very poor. Shuttling between screens is distracting, and the screen does hold finger prints very easily. There should be some dash button to push for the most common features, e.g. cutting off Eco mode and 360 camera. Mileage so far is not ok and disappointing. Has yet to average 20 mpg much less the advertised mileage. Interior wood trim  (driftwood because Volvo ran out of other wood grain colors) and  leather colors are limited and a bit ugly compared to all competitors. The newer electric silver exterior color is very handsome and would be prettier if the interior leather options included a true beige with walnut trim. My wife really likes the car, but I can say I barely like it.That might change after we take it on a trip. Were it not for the dealer, with whom we have had a long, wonderful relationship and is excellent, I probably would like the 2018 XC60 Inscription T6 less. Just hope it is durable and lasts for the 10 years my wife had a Toyota Sienna. "

Ride is too although maybe not as playful/connected to the road as our 2014 X3 2.8. There are times when the 2.0 of the XC60 is less refined than that of the X3, say accelerating up a long hill, but the XC60 wins in overall comfort in my opinion. I liked the lane keeping feature at first but now find it annoying. If you change lanes without signaling the car will fight with you. Luckily it can be deactivated and left off. Unfortunately, the start/stop needs to be deactivated every time car is started, requiring a couple extra swipes of center screen that gets old. Leading edge of sun roof sun screen buzzes but can be addressed by rolling it back a cm or so. Traffic flow status, green/orange/red colors, took a while to figure out how to enable by activating car modem in communication menu. Sometimes the center screen menus can be a bit slow to boot up when car is started. Overall very happy so far. "

Their Scandinavian design, simplicity and their attention to complete safety is what kept me with them for many years. With the recent changes with Volvo, it’s only more clear that their future is going to be amazing. They have completely rethought their car line, and with the new XC60 they are gonna be very recognizable on any road.

This is my first SUV, and I wouldn’t have gotten it if it wasn’t for the beautiful design of XC60. This size is not too big and not so compact like other luxury makers. I got the T8 Twin Engine trim with 10 kWh battery that gives 18-20 miles range on pure electric drive.

My favorite things about the car:
-air suspension is incredibly comfortable and soft
-remote start, pre-cooling, pre-heating all though the Volvo App is amazing, even works with my Apple Watch
-comfort and quietness of the cabin
-design of the interior and the screen interface and interaction
-internet in the car, over the air updates of all maps, installation of free apps
-Volvo’s own sound system is superb
-Spotify 
-Apple CarPlay
-Autonomous Drive is very accurate from everyday driving to work
-auto braking and crash avoidance is amazing
-once a year maintenance is a breeze
-electric drive is so smooth and quick, it almost feels like a mini Tesla
-LED lights are beautiful and bright enough in all situations I’ve experienced
-size of the XC60 is just right

Things that can improve:
-Volvo needs to work with dealerships more and be allowed to fully update the car over-the-air
-charging speed could improve with time, with software updates too
-transition from engine to electric needs more ironing out
-more options and controls in the user interface and the screen, few more options to make the car your own and have more customizations
-Volvo needs to help plug-in hybrids to find charging stations, they kind of let that up to the driver

Overall this is the best car I’ve even driven, even comparing it to cars I’ve been in, like Audi and BMW, Volvo always takes on extra points on character, design, and comfort. This is truly Scandinavian philosophy, nothing more and nothing less, just what you need, and after driving it everyday I can see it very well. "

Didnt even bother testing the made in mexico Audi Q5.   
Far & Away, the Volvo T6 hp, torque, and highway passing performance are all superior to the other base engine suvs I tested,  & at only a modest price premium for the very impressive T6 engine, which I average 24mpg here in Denver.

I’m a tablet pc user, so I really enjoy the intuitive, in dash, touch screen on the volvo, and the Heads up Display for speed & nav.  Only the jag was similar.  The Porche Macan is a low tech, dated suv, & very disappointing as a result.  My 2nd choice was the Merc GLC which is a close 2nd to the XC60 performance wise, but it can’t match the high tech in the Volvo, and could not take a class 3 trailer hitch like the volvo can.

My only knocks on the volvo are  minor, ie Boot time for the screen needs to be faster,  Bliss doesn’t work with my bike on the trailer rack, The engine stop/start can’t be turned off indefinitely, 
Wiper switches are overly sensitive to accidental activation, sun screen is too big & slow to operate, Handling wise the car is at least 200lbs too heavy & tends to plow into corners on twisting mtn roads, and the highway collision avoidance system is a bit over sensitive at high speeds of 75+ mph.

This is my first volvo car, and overall I’ve found it to be a great suv with a lot of value due to it’s balance of doing so many things well vs the competition.   "

The Volvo had everything on our wish list and for us was the most comfortable car to drive (e.g., the legendary Volvo seats are great on long trips).  We got all Volvo options on the car except the more powerful engine (e.g., the T5 engine power is more than adequate for suburban driving) and the air suspension (e.g., the steel suspension felt fine to us, but that is a subjective decision). We have had the car for six months with no issues and after a short time mastered the sensus connect and all the new features the car came with. If you decide to buy a Volvo look into the European Delivery Option.  The Volvo delivery process in Sweden was great and we had a wonderful time in Scandinavia. You will also be surprised, as we were, with the travel benefits that come with the program and the additional savings we received off the purchase price.   "

It's still slow but I'd no longer consider it a hazard.

This is a very well made car with a couple of significant issues. One, the Sensus system is not good. Don't get me wrong, it looks beautiful with it's big center screen and has lots of features. The problem is it is slow.  Two, the ride is ridiculously rough. Going over anything larger than a small divot in the road sounds like a sledgehammer hitting the suspension. I don't know who drove this car in pre-production testing and thought this was acceptable but that person should be fired and never allowed to work in vehicle engineering again. 

On the upside the car looks beautiful inside and out. It really looks like it was lovingly handcrafted, particularly the seats which are amazing. The engine, despite being tiny, puts out a really surprising amount of power. Unfortunately the gas mileage is not good. However, I've found that if I use ""eco"" mode I can do pretty well on mixed city and highway driving and right now I'm at 23.7mpg. The Pilot Assist is reasonably capable. On a highway with well painted lines it can keep you in your lane as long as your hand is on the wheel. Obviously it doesn't have any of that next level stuff you see in Teslas but at least Volvo is trying...hopefully the system will get better with software updates (right now it just gets totally lost if the lines are faded). However this model will obviously never get any major Pilot Assist upgrades, the hardware can't handle it.

As for value I pumped that up to 4 stars because as far as I can tell I can sell the car right now for almost what I paid for it which is pretty amazing. Granted there aren't many 2018's for sale yet so the market isn't very deep. But as a comparison, my prior Ford Edge had lost almost 1/2 of it's value at the same point in it's life.

I've upped my overall review to 4 stars and it's really only losing a star for the very rough ride which is a darn shame. I assume volvo CAN make a car that doesn't feel like I'm riding on bare metal but they just didn't and I can't figure out why. I can understand why Sensus is slow, they just didn't put in a powerful enough processor which, while also a shame, is kinda understandable because very large center screens are fairly new. But suspensions are very much not new and there is no excuse, none, for how rough this car rides. But overall, assuming it's not going over bumps, it's a great car that could get even better if the next software update improves the Sensus and the Pilot Assist (hint hint volvo this review could go to 5 stars).

I pre-ordered the car and came from Sweden as one of the first R-design model available. I really love the car, it is so comfortable and so perfectly finished that I can only hope the reliability of the brand matches its fit and finish.  The engine could be a bit more refined but for a 4000+lbs SUV it does the job really well. The transmission is great and it works just as expected depending on the MODE you have set. (ECO, COMFORT, or DYNAMIC) One of the features I like the most is the center screen as well as the digital instrument panel, it is well made and has so many options that allow to customize depending on what the driver wants.  I tested many SUVs and it truly was the best of the bunch. I will only hope the reliability is what I am expecting but so far so good. (specially when all maintenance is covered by  Volvo, It is an incredible warranty and great piece of mind)

Update on the Volvo XC60: 06/17/19
The car has become my second car, now that I get to compare the two I realize how great this car really is. Still a little noisy, coming from the engine compartment but since tire noise is more notable at high speeds it doesn't seem to bother me as much only at high revs on low speeds. I currently have 13000+ miles so I am still hoping for reliability to be good but so far I have done brakes under warranty (because the wheel would shake a bit under braking with some uneven feel. The dealer said they had a re-design or quality recall by Volvo.)  At this point only complaint is that I'm trying to get Volvo to replace some window trimming that is pitted (or some kind of rust on the mate finish of the windows bezels.) Last time I took it to the dealership they said that they couldn't see it but it is still there. 

Everything else is working great granted I'm not driving it as much. "

My new Volvo XC60 is a very nice car, great features, however if you are thinking of buying one there are a few issues that bother me:

-The sideview mirrors tend to not open when the weather is cold

-When the windows get wet or frosty they go up and down extremely slowly

-We opened the driver door on a day when the winds were 10-20mph the wind took the door, causing a pin to break and requiring over $1000 in body work - not covered by any warranty  

-To reset the apps that are on the computer display in the car, you have to drive for 30 minutes over 50mph

Fields Volvo of Northfield said “All these things were not covered or acts of God.” 

When I tried to get Volvo USA involved because I feel that these are design flaws, I was given the run-around and a snow job and I found it nearly impossible to get Volvo USA to take it seriously.

The car is driven daily already has close to 13500 miles so I have definitely broken it in and spent lots of time in this vehicle.  I have to admit this car was not my first choice.  I wanted a Honda CRV.  I traded a 2004 Honda CRV with over 160K miles for this suv.  I never had any issues with that car or my Honda before that one.  One major complaint is the lack of an owner's manual.  The manual is in the car's infotainment system or you have to download it to a phone or other device.  This is really inconvenient, especially when experiencing a problem.  Twice I experienced turn signal and windshield wiper malfunctions.  Warnings were popping up in the center console and the infotainment system (and don't get me started on how cumbersome that is to operate).   Neither functions operated so makes vehicle unable to be operated in any precipitation.  Very scary to drive when you have 3 children in the car and losing functions.  Also received a battery failure warning on the first occasion.  1st time back to the dealership they had to wipe the computer clean and download all the software again.  Took hrs.  Was promised car fixed.  2nd time (yesterday) they replaced the turn signal and wiper module which was defective.  Took hrs.  Was promised was fixed.  We shall see. It is sad when you carry a towel in the car to wipe mist, etc off you windshield.  The dealer showed me pages of error codes that were downloaded from the car from malfunctions.   I think there is another problem with the computer because now it is taking a long time to load the instrument panel.  Also seem to be getting strange images showing up on screen.  Hard to describe.  The nav updates constantly and that was also fixed yesterday by re-downloading the software.  Dealer said it was stuck in a downloading loop.  The nav is terrible, we call it the crazy gps because it sends us all over the place.  I hook up the android auto and use google gps instead.  12V power outlet in front center console already blew a fuse.  Never had that happen in any vehicle I have ever owned.  Door trim on driver's side passenger door replaced due to manufacturing defect.  I have begun taking pictures and videos of malfunction warnings and irregularities have been experiencing.  So I have documentation of all issues.  So far everything covered under warranty but worried about future.  Had high hopes and expectations for this suv but I already want to get rid of the vehicle.

Definitely Volvo has earned his position as luxury brand. I did test drive Audi Q5, MB GLC and BMW X3. I leaned towards the Volvo, for excellent design exterior and interior, although I have to admit it was a difficult choice, except for the MB GLC which was ruled out right away due to its outdated features and poor exterior design. The XC 60 is extremelly comfortable to drive, with the Inscription trim it looks awesome, modern and offering a sense of peace and quiet inside. I will focus my review on things that should be better (hence my 4 star rate instead of 5). Some of the materials in the lower part of the dashboard, doors and central console should be of better quality for a $ 54K vehicle. Performance is its weakest part, I got the T6 because compared to Audi Q5 or BMW X3 acceleration and quick shifting was subpar on the T5, with the T6 it gets better (in dynamic mode) but still it is not an Audi, so if you are looking for spirited performance go with the Q5 or the X3. Fuel consumption is poor, and definitely below what Volvo advertises. Noisy during acceleration, once you cruise it is quiet. On the Inscription trim premium sound should be standard (as it is in the Q5), so I decided to go with the regular audio system (definitely not great sound. Go with the Bowers & Wilkins premium sound if you can afford it. It is worthy). Suspension is on the harsh side. Don't get me wrong, overall is a fantastic car, interior feeling is luxurious and safety features and infotainment is last generation. Exterior and interior design is outstanding (Audi or BMW are not closer. Their interiors are boring ). "

We now are almost 7 months and 6,000 miles into ownership. While the seats felt comfortable at first, one round trip of 4 hours each way left my wife aching all over. The headrest is fixed. For some it will throw the head forward and for others the gap between back seat and headrest causes upper shoulder and neck fatigue. The seat bottom bolsters also are pronounced and fairly stiff. These headrest and seat features have caused my wife such significant hip and neck pain that she is seeing a physical therapist and has required her to switch to driving my Audi A6. I now have been assigned to the XC60 which was not my choice of vehicles. 
Until just recently we had yet to get over 24 mpg on a trip, and the city mileage rarely exceeded 15 mpg. I got 28.9 on a recent 150 mile round trip by letting the cruise control etc essentially drive the car. 
Access to surround camera for parking is cumbersome, as it does not engage automatically even if the car is in reverse. (Audi has a split screen) In many circumstances we need to stop the vehicle, put it in neutral, slide the screen, find the camera icon and then touch the 360 icon. Setting destinations remains hit or miss, though the Bluetooth interface with our iPhones is very good. I am still wondering whether future info system updates will improve visual effects and function. No promises have been made by dealer. 
We have thought of selling the car to buy or trading for another brand with more comfortable seats. Those options are out of the question because we’d take too big a financial hit off the price paid for the XC60. Our experience is that the more comfortably riding SUVs or Crossovers either do not have some of the safety and convenience features we want, or truly are not comparable or have not been given very good owner ratings. 
So, my wife and I decided to keep the XC60 for at least a couple years, switch cars to break in the seats for a period the seats can be better broken in.  "

The voice recognition is the worse I have used in over 10 years - it may as well not even be there. Road noise in this car is far higher than many much lower priced cars - I would have expected a car in this price range to be much quieter. The foot operated tailgate very seldom works. It has a lot of safety technology but because of the lack of an operating voice recognition and the poor traction in bad weather, it is really not a safer car at all. Plenty of cargo space, very good fuel mileage, plenty of power and drives and rides well on dry roads. It is very poor on snow covered roads; almost scary. I would definitely not buy another one. I changed the tires in an attempt to get a quieter ride - no good but better traction than the factory tires. I have also been to three dealers and none of them are at all helpful with any of the problems. After two years owning this vehicle, I am hoping to be able to trade it for something better "

Dealer said tires had to be balanced and aligned. $300 later it did not resolve the issue.  Started reading on forums of other Volvo owners having the exact same problems.  Almost all of them said the dealer said it was the tires.  IT’S NOT THE TIRES.  I printed out a technical journal for this problem and they did have the car for several days and did all the recommended “fixes” - did not solve it. Regional field rep was called in. He admitted that he felt the vibration. Said he had it on his Volvo and that getting Michelin tires seemed to help.  Again, IT’S NOT THE TIRES.

They were on backorder and could not get one for a while.  Had to put up a fuss to get a loaner until they were able to get a new one.  Next - the trunk even after the recall needs to be slammed shut about half the time.  3rd -  needed to replace the breaks with under 20,000 miles - rotors warped.  4th the electronics system is TERRIBLE - sometimes the backup camera comes on - sometimes it doesn't - and sometimes it stays on even in drive. So slow to respond to any command.   5th - the passenger seat makes the worst noise.  Rattle from the dash board almost makes it impossible to take conference calls from the car.

The car is comfortable, quiet. It's the only car that I've owned that you can drive 500 miles straight, get out, and have absolutely no soreness. While the T5 has plenty of power above 2,000 RPM, it is sluggish off the line. I think I would opt for a T6 next time. The safety features are great and the semi-autonomous driving is fun and a little addicting. Interior of the car is striking and very user friendly. Have had a chance to take the car out in the snow, and it handles fantastic. Reviews continually say that the touch screen is hard to use, but we found it very user friendly and have had no issues. Did have to have the brake pads replaced on all four tires at 20,0000 miles, which seems like an awfully short lifespan for the pads. "

I bought it new because I wanted a luxury car with environmental qualities and after researching, was pleased with the positive reviews.  I mostly drive around town, so the 18 MPGe were perfect.  We had an electrician come and install a 240 outlet in our garage for faster charging.  Two and a half years later the battery will only charge to 12 MPGe.  Took it in for servicing and they said, ""per the owners manual, the car is performing as it should.""  I looked in the owners manual.  Here's what it says:

The capacity of the hybrid battery diminishes somewhat with age and use, which could result in increased use of the gasoline engine and consequently, slightly higher fuel consumption.

I am so very disappointed.  Good luck trying to trade this car in...who wants a hybrid that is loosing it's hybrid capacity.  I just want to warn those who may want to buy the newly advertised XC90's.  If you only want the car for two years, go for it.  But don't expect much out of this hybrid in the long run. "

It's a beautiful and comfortable car but I can't wait to give it back.  The front dashboard rattles miserably on the highway.  It truly drives me mad and makes me feel like I'm driving a Yugo.  The dealer said they put padding/insulation but it has not fixed the problem.  The 13 mile electric range is too low to be useful and the raspy 4 cylinder engine provides unrefined power/acceleration.   The brakes and brake feel do not inspire confidence.  I've also had countless technology glitches.  For example, the wipers decided to stop working right before a heavy rain storm.  I rushed home, parked and charged the car, and the next morning before I could call the dealer the system reset itself and worked fine.  Strangely inconvenient.  These type of random technology glitches happen unexpectedly and too often to be normal.  The pilot assist moves the car around too much and the car does not track straight.  Tire wear has been excessive.  Disappointing to say the least, especially given the leather seats are beautiful and car is beyond comfortable.   "
812,XC60,2019,4.1, 08/23/2018,Steve in Louisiana,T6 R-Design 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),117 of 124 people found this review helpful,Upon Further Review...Volvo XC60 T6 R-Design is it,4,"In trying to find a new car replacement for my 9 year old Audi A4 3.2L Prestige S-Line, many vehicles were considered ranging from Audi (A4, S4, Q5, SQ5), Mercedes (C series, GLC), Mazda (CX5, 6), VW (GLI, Tiguan), Honda (Accord, Pilot), and a few others.  After months of reading articles, owner reviews, and searching websites like Edmunds, etc., it was time to make a choice.  Using my admittedly personal weighting system, many factors such as exterior styling, fuel economy, ease of ingress/egress (some of us are getting older and less flexible than we used to be), interior functionality, safety, and more were evaluated and, as can be read, the Volvo XC60 T6 R-Design was selected and ordered to get the exact option packages we wanted.  We ordered the car in February of this year as a 2018 model year, but the 2019 model was delivered 4 mos. later.  The Dealership held the 2018 agreed price on the more heavily featured 2019 model so thanks Volvo for that.  We strongly considered the T8 (hybrid) version but ultimately rejected it because the new car is intended for highway trips and the additional 500lbs or so would hinder highway fuel mileage.  While we only have 1500 miles on the R-Design, so far it is everything I had hoped it would be.  It is a superbly comfortable and quiet highway cruiser (indicated 28.2 mpg Interstate, 24.5 mpg combined) that provides a safe, serene, solid, and yes, even sporty-ish driving experience.
Learning the new tech and interface in the center console takes a bit of a homework, but once the preferences are set and the short learning curve is attained, controls seem logical and well laid-out.  Steering wheel controls and voice commands handle the majority of routine functions (e.g. radio/music selection and volume, cabin temperature, text message response, automatic cruise control, Pilot Assist, etc.)  Favorite features so far include the 1) aforementioned auto-cruise control, head-up display, 2) Bowers & Wilkins audio system, 3) fuel economy, 4) comfortable R-Design seats, and 5) general driving dynamics.  A few of my nit-picky dislikes in no particular order are: 1) lack of a sunglasses holder in a overhead bin 2) somewhat unpleasant engine sound under moderately hard acceleration (cruising noise is virtually silent) 3) lack of available CD player (yes, I'm showing my age, but I have a lot of CDs).

UPDATE:  FOURTEEN MONTHS LATER

The XC60 continues to meet and exceed my expectations.  After several 600 mile round trips, puttering around town, and  a total of 18,600 miles on the odometer, there are ZERO mechanical, electrical, interface, or infotainment issues. None.  No squeaks, rattles, shimmies, or, loose trim pieces.

 The  R-Design has had one oil change service and software update (neither of which cost me anything) and another service is due in a couple of weeks.  The engine has not used any oil in the roughly 9000 miles of use since the last oil change.  The A/C system is terrific, cooling the interior quickly in these hot summer months.  All the safety systems continue to function as advertised and impress my occasional work mate passengers.  Interstate cruising is quiet, relaxing, and unstressful.  Certainly the driver still needs to monitor the road and input steering as required, but the automatic cruise control and lane keeping systems help the miles melt by. 

Fuel mileage also continues in the upper 27-28 mpg range at interstate cruising speeds (70-75 mph), and strictly around town driving yields low 20s mpg.  We continue to appreciate the very comfortable seats, excellent Bowers & Wilkins audio system, and roomy interior.  The XC60 is the optimum size for us and our travel and commuting needs.

Because this is my first experience, much less, my first ownership of a Volvo product, I was very skeptical.  The vehicle would have to ""win me over"".   After nearly 18 months of living with it, would I recommend the Volvo XC60 T6 R-Design?  Unquestionably. "

Overall love the car, but it isn’t perfect. Here’s a list of my perceived flaws: 1) Engine is loud & shifting is not smooth in lower gears; 2) You can not respond to a text unless you’re connected to Android auto/Apple Play; 3) Rain sensing wipers must be turned on/off & are not actually automatic. Technically these are first world problems, but when paying this much money, you expect all the bells & whistles.
Also, after only having 500 miles on the car, the check engine light came on. At first, the dealer said it was a faulty O2 sensor & could be replaced within minutes. He then told me that sensor had been installed incorrectly and they would need to order a new wire. I was given a 2019 XC60 Rdesign as a loaner (which I liked the acceleration way better than my T5). This was a huge annoyance, especially after only owning the car for less than 2 weeks.
Now what I do love: 1) Smooth & quiet ride; 2) Excellent center display & easy to use technology; 3) Excellent safety features in the lane assist, blind spot monitoring (which go crazy in the car wash); 4) 25 mpg average gas mileage; 5) My favorite feature is the remote start from my phone - I live in Florida & being able to cool my car before I drive is priceless.
Again, overall I love the car, but it isn’t without it’s flaws. Would definitely get another. "

Living in Wisconsin with a ton of snow in the winter I decided to go for the hybrid AND AWD option just in case. The disappointing part is that I got a check engine light less than 24 hours after getting the car. Not even 50 miles on the odometer. Apparently it was a faulty battery thermostat that had to be changed, which took almost 2 weeks to get it done. No check engine lights after that but it's been only 4 months. So I'm crossing my fingers hoping nothing else happens. Another crazy event was the head up display not working right after fueling but that was just once and resolved on it's own.
The car is great on electric mode and the charge is more than enough to make it to work and back home but I can charge at work if needed. It's nice to be able to forget when it was the last time the car was fueled while having the baseline power to make it through a nasty snowstorm with a foot of snow on the ground. The interior is impeccable, sound is excellent and safety features are a must. 360 degree cameras and parking assistance eventually become second nature and you may miss those when driving something else. Pilot assist has worked as expected during long distance drives of course depending on reliable road markings and weather. It's nice to get used to the quiet ride while on Pure or electric hybrid mode but the engine is loud and angry when kicking in during extreme weather changes. Fans turn on and off all the time while charging which can be annoying but I've had the same strange noises happening while the card is parked on a fuel engine XC90.
If you're thinking about buying a T8, invest in the higher output outlet for faster charging and have realistic expectations regarding electric range factoring in the use of AC/heating and audio. Driving in B mode helps a bit but won't get anything meaningfully recharged. Last thing. Visibility. It's like seeing for the first time and having extra eyes at the right time. "

This car costs way less than the Model X and has a stated electric range of 17 miles. If you are commuting more than say 30-40 miles a day, this car probably makes no sense. It’s mileage with no charge as a “normal” hybrid is not great, I would say bad even by hybrid standards - and might even be worse than the full gas version if you drive on the highway a lot. 

With that out of the way, for the right person, this is a wondrous technological marvel. The interior is luxurious and I’m getting about 80mpg. I’ve had it for almost a month and have used a third of a tank of gas because my daily commute is about 13 miles round trip. I live in an urban area and my trips rarely exceed the battery range, so for me it’s perfect.

Now, one thing I will emphasize that I didn’t realize at first and I feel is not talked about enough with this car I s the need to “precondition” the climate before leaving. You can do this through the Volvo app or set a timer. It only works when it’s plugged in, but doing so will get the interior climate comfortable, which is nice, but more critically it gets the car’s other components prepped and to the right temp range so you can go straight away in all electric. Otherwise, like on my return trip home (no charger at work), the engine will run for the first few minutes, regardless of charge. 

For me the biggest con is the infotainment and nav system. The infotainment system controls a raft of features, down to surprisingly fine detail in some instances. But that makes it really complex and hard to navigate. It seems needlessly complex in some ways, like audio and other settings existing in two separate menus (somewhat different controls in each) and something as seemingly simple as setting and moving through favorite radio stations is completely unintuitive. I find the nav system confusing and the street labels do not match on occasion on the heads up display, which is an otherwise cool feature. I prefer waze or google maps thru Apple Car Play, even though for some reason it isn’t able to integrate with the heads up display. And the whole system is pretty slow to boot up, as noted by others. On the whole though, I’ve adjusted and it’s a relatively minor gripe.

Other minor gripes: it would be great to have one touch access to the 360 camera like others have noted, and the self-parking mode is cool but doesn’t always work completely right (if you are paying attention at all it’s easy to override it to keep from hitting the curb) and also takes some time to set up. 

I have yet to really test the AWD but so far in rainy conditions I’ve had no traction problems. It’s not uncommon in my area for dealers to push 21 or 22 inch tires on these things and that could make a big negative difference I would think.

I will also note that I see no need to invest in the faster charging. I use the regular plug and it charges overnight. On the weekends I never really drive so much that I need the quick charge either, but I suppose that depends on your personal situation. 

One other thing I will note is the talk about depreciation in some reviews. Well yes, I expect this to have a severe drop upfront. Partly because this is a niche car, really best for those in a more urban environment, and partly because of the $5k tax break that comes with it. Getting that plus model year end pricing allowed me to close much of the the gap with the non-hybrid. Hopefully it holds close to the gas version over time. 

Overall, we have had no complaints at all with this car and could not be more satisfied. I would definitely recommend reading the manual for this if you do purchase. The mileage has been even better than I thought it would be, once I figured out the preconditioning. It is a truly luxurious experience driving in this thing. We upgraded from an older Mazda and this is just a totally different experience, to the point we still can’t believe this is our car.  "

1.  The phone disconnects from the system after a couple of hours. VOLVO blames this on Apple CarPlay and says they can do nothing about it.

This is after reading about how proud VOLVO is to have Apple CarPlay in their SUV's in 2019. Please don't offer it in your cars if you can't figure out how to get it to sync with the VOLVO computer system.

2.  The radio turns on in the car when the car has been turned off and the keys are in the house and the car is in my garage.  VOLVO says that the car must be locked, in my locked garage - - in order for the car to be completely powered down. 

3.  The radio doesn't consistently turn down when replying to a text. You never know when it's going to work or not work.

4.  With nothing on the passenger car seat, the red light in the instrument panel flashes on and off, indicating that the seatbelt should be turned on.

There has been no issues with it after having it for nearly a year and putting 12k Kim’s on it. It is a beast of an SUV and the 400hp combined output is transferred well to the road. It isn’t the quietest in its class but the funnest to drive. The combined consumption for the 11k Kim’s driven is 4.2 l/100kms which is absolutely insane for a 2 ton suv. This includes daily work commutes, weekend trips and longer road trips with charging every day when at home. So far there is nothing not to love about the xc60. It handles very well, is balanced, has the most beautiful interior and crushes most of the other SUV’s in its class such as the Lexus’. It is great value and performance for the money.  "

The XC60 is just much more practical. I, too, fell in love with the design - particularly the LED daytime running lights and great interior so we took the plunge and bought a T5, Momentum. To me, the interior is class-leading and unlike anything I've seen another automaker attempt perhaps except for Tesla. HOWEVER, I will say that function clearly took a backseat to the modern, minimalist interior design . I'm in my 30s and very tech-savvy and I can't imagine anyone over 50 operating this car without a lot of frustration. Essentially all of the controls are operated via the touchscreen interface. I don't personally have an issue with this but Volvo sorely needs to improve the user experience of their infotainment. It can be a lot of swiping and tapping to make even a simple AC adjustment. Plus, it can be slow to boot up when you start the car. The infotainment does have some upsides - crisp graphics, very clear back-up camera, etc. But my other vehicle is a Jeep with Chrysler's excellent UConnect system and it's embarrassing how much more intuitive and responsive Chrysler's system is. The theme of design over function continues really throughout the car. There's little space in the center console because for whatever reason Volvo chose to place both an old-school shifter AND the ignition switch here. I guess they didn't want to mess up their minimalist dashboard design with a push-start or dial/button shifter. These things just become more apparent as you spend time with the vehicle, beautiful as it is. We have the T5 turbo-charged four cylinder and it's perfectly suited for this size vehicle. Getting the T6 would be overkill in my opinion. However, I can't imagine driving the larger XC90 with either engine. I know Volvo is heading toward electrification but a 6 cylinder is badly needed in their line-up. It sounds like I'm beating up on Volvo, I know, but I do honestly love our XC60 despite a few complaints. The exterior styling is elegant but not overdone. The interior is just top quality on every surface you touch. With some improvements in function, I think this SUV would be an absolute home run.  "

So far, I love driving it. The option to shift from Hybrid mode to Performance. It tightens up the steering and lowers the car. You can feel the difference and it makes the car more fun to drive. It does take a little to learn all the different driving options, however. 
Ultimately, I bought this car for:
1. SPACE. I can fit everything from 3 carseats along the back seat to my dogs in the back to a very large stroller, groceries, ect. The built in booster seat will be an added bonus as my grandchildren get bigger. 
2. ACCESSORIES. The seats are super comfortable. I love the sunroof. The sound is amazing. It's perfect for me and it's got tons of help. The adaptive cruise control and pilot assist work extremely well. I love all the camera views especially the 360 overhead. It's well calibrated and accurate. 3. GAS MILEAGE. I was worried about gas mileage. I've charged it several times but I'm at over 430 miles with 1/4 tank left and about 80 more estimated miles to go. I drive a combo of streets and highways. The streets I am on are often 45/50 mph so I was worried that the hybrid battery would have little effect. It seems to contribute well to gas efficiency. 
Further, the car isn't too big. I didn't want to drive a behemoth that is difficult to park. I realized it's about the length of my husbands Tesla Model S and is easy to maneuver in and out of tight spacing. The 360 overhead is definitely a bonus!!! You can see everything if you are a little concerned. 
Ultimately, I wanted a bigger car that could fit my 2 dogs and 3 young grandchildren (4 and under) that was fun to drive and didn't guzzle gas like crazy. The XC 60 T8 Hybrid delivered. "

I have had one four days now and I absolutely love it.  I can not find anything to criticize  about the car.  You pay for what you get and I feel every option was worth the price.  The Volvo drives rock steady on the road and I feel the engine is adequate.  I had some concerns about the 6 cylinder but it does the job.  So far in mixed driving I am averaging 20MPG.  I think with highway driving that will increase.  Bluetooth is now built in and works superbly.  The radio/telephone controls are mixed together and are a little overwhelming at first but work as designed.  The seats are very comfortable and love the R-Design color scheme.  Love this car!

Recently, after purchasing a 2013 XC60 in 2014, after owning this car for 1 year (and enjoying the advanced electronic features), I happily 'traded-down' for a 2011 XC90 ! Comparatively the XC60's driving experience confirmed the car was driving me, momentum not balanced and did not hug the road in the manner to which I've become accustomed. My 2011 XC90 (2nd in the family, and my 6th Volvo) had much better visibility, truly hugged the road with confidence of an automatic all-wheel drive the way it should - with fierce grip yet a smooth driving experience. I do not believe the XC60 has 'matured' enough in engineering the actual driving experience (rather they concentrated on features) that the XC90 has claimed. It is not a speed-demon by any means, however it accelerates at higher speeds beautifully (turbo), and my driving confidence in any weather or road condition (having driven through Adirondack blizzards with other all-wheel cars crawling or stopping) knowing I and my loved ones are safe and comfortable.

When I initially read the reviews before purchasing it, I saw many complaints over the gas mileage.

I am happy with the gas mileage. The comfortable (heated) seats, the sophisticated look and other added features I didn't have in my Endeavor, make me very happy. "

As far as the design of the vehicle when it comes to safety it is 100% safe during the first 36K miles. After that you are rolling the dice. My wife and I have had to have the driver side seatbelt replaced twice which tells me Volvo went cheap on things you can't see. I have never had to have a seatbelt replaced. I have had cars with 190K miles on them that had the original factory seatbelts in them that hadn't been replaced. Next, the AC system went out on my wife with no warning with less than 36K miles on it. Luckily, our vehicle has always been under warranty. Manual lumbar support; are you kidding me???? Even my 97 Ford Explorer had electric lumbar support. Do not buy this vehicle used. New with a warranty is your safest bet. Also, if you plan on keeping this vehicle long term make sure you maintain the warranty and have a maintenance package. You will regret it if you don't. The level of tech in this vehicle for a 2011 make car is weak. Volvo tried to make a huge jump with their new XC-90, which I have driven, and that was a tech blunder as far as the infotainment system goes. Overall, I think Volvo is trying to save money by making subtle changes/upgrades to current model vehicles but they are trying to make big leaps when they re-design their vehicles which introduces too many changes in one package which in my opinion creates too many potential problems. Also, support for Volvo along the Gulf Coast is very weak. There are only two dealerships in my area and they are both 30 or more minutes away. Do not buy this vehicle if your nearest dealership is more than an hour away. You will burn up a lot of gas to have it serviced. Don't use third party repair shops or parts. You're just going to be throwing away your money. 5 September 2020 follow-up:  At this point my wife and I have had this car for 9 years with 66000 miles on it and for a 9 year old car I would still give it a three star rating: Additional things that have gone wrong since my last review.  The passenger side BLIS sensor constantly gives false indications or the whole system locks up when the vehicle is first started up. The moonroof cover is no longer connected to the track it was in and btw, my wife and I have rarely used the moonroof.  The headliner up by the windshield has started to delaminate. This is a 2011 vehicle and my 1997 Eddie Bauer's, headliner stayed intact the whole time we had it and we bought that in 2003.  The only reason why I got rid of the Ford was because it had 200K miles and major parts were starting to fail.  Also, the AC system has never been the same since the time it went out.  The receiver for the driver's side seatbelt has also started having issues with locking in the belt.  In short, do not by this body style Volvo, no matter what price the dealer is offering it to you at.  You'll dump more money into keeping it running and in decent conditon than the monthly payment unless you buy it outright. I think they stopped making this version of the XC-90 around 2015. On another note, do not buy a new Volvo XC-90 until they put manual AC controls on the dash again because everything is under the iPad menus right now.  I know it sounds stupid but if you live somewhere outside of Europe where you have blistering hot summers you need back-up controls for your AC just in case the iPad display dies and yes iPads do fail and they are even more likely to fail if you can't park your car in a garage when you aren't using it.  This vehicle is a has been.  Not worth the money as used or certified pre-owned. In short, stay away from these XC-90s. "

I have two young kids, wanted them to learn to drive in city traffic in this so they are safe.  Four year in and to date, this vehicle has performed it's job protecting my children.  Even when I purchased this vehicle back years ago, the dashboard and functionality was outdated, but my focus was safety.  I told the salesman that my only two criteria for an XC90 was that the car is white and that it has to have a navigation system.  

Today, I am burdened with a vehicle that works well mechanically, but the navigation system does not work consistently.  Yes, I have an iPhone.  No, I do not want to use it for navigation.   In February, 2015, I contacted the dealer who sold me the vehicle and told them of my navigation/backup camera issue (the backup camera comes on, then the screen goes black and the window stays up, and the navigation system is completely disabled).  I took the vehicle into the dealer for software updates SIX times in one year.  The fix has never been installed because it does not exist.  Volvo has given up on fixing the software, they have thrown up their hands and advised me they are never going to fix it.

They have offered to ""allow"" me to trade in this vehicle for a new one; they were generous and offered me incentives being offered to everyone right now.  The dealer will not give more, they will lose money.  It's the Volvo manufacturing company that has turned their head and is not supporting their product.

They can fix it, they have to hire a software engineer to find the bug and fix it.  They have chosen not to.  Therefore, they are refusing to repair a vehicle they manufactured.   Clearly printed in their documentation, ""From Design, Engineering, and Manufacturing to support activities in Parts, Service, and Sales, high standards have been set to help insure your satisfaction and pride as an owner of a Volvo.”     I am neither satisfied nor proud.  

I could have purchased any SUV for my family with a third row seat.  I chose this one, my very first Volvo, because of the company reputation and the research that I did indicating they were a solid company that stood behind their products.  Boy, was I fooled.  

Could of bought a Mercedes.  Could of bought an Audi.  Could have bought a Lexus.    I have owned a vehicle from each of those manufacturers in the past and never run into a problem with maintenance or repair.   Now I will suffer the price when I trade in this vehicle and take a lesser amount for the manufacturer's defect.   So, I guess I'm paying for the navigation system twice!   

Is the vehicle a complete loss?  No, the vehicle itself has worked fine mechanically.  It is truly unfortunate that the only upgrade option that I requested is the one thing that failed.  What strikes me the hardest is the lack of support from the manufacturer.  I will never buy another Volvo again. "

It had every available package, except air suspension. We also had the 21"" upgraded wheels, and later added the towing package when the parts became available a couple weeks later. 

We also have Apple CarPlay that was provided by the dealer at no additional cost. Just recently we paid to have the Auto Pilot upgraded to Auto Pilot Assist 2 for 2017. 

So far we've loved it. We also renewed our Volvo on Call service through the rest of the life our vehicle loan because we like the remote start feature since we live in Colorado where we get snow during the winter. 

We've had the vehicle almost two full years now with minimal issues. I've noticed several reviews that gave bad ratings due to software issues. We've never had any issues with software but only once when the OS would randomly reboot itself. That ended up getting fixed with a software update at the dealership. We haven't had any trouble since.

Mechanically we've only had 3 issues, the rear brakes were heavily squealing. They gave us the upgraded rotors due to that being a known issue on early 2016 models which was covered under warranty. 

Our second mechanical issue came when the blinkers would fail to work and it popped an error. We brought it into service, and they replaced the entire assembly, new controls, wiring, and software which fixed the issue. They had the car for two days but they've always given us a loaner vehicle, even when brought in for a regular interval service. Everything was covered under warranty. 

We also had a fuel sensor go out, which was also under warranty. We've gotten a few recalls since we've had the vehicle, but none were ever issues that would jeopardize safety and all were fixed promptly at the dealership, about 95% of them were all software recalls. That has been the extent of any trouble we've seen, which to us has been pretty minimal. 

Volvo's service department near us has been absolutely wonderful, and some of the best service we've gotten from any industry. They go out of their way to make us 100% happy when we step out that door and we've been extremely happy with customer service. 

Now for nitpicks we didn't like after owning it for this amount of time. There needs to be more USB ports. The 2016 model only has one in the entire vehicle. In all honesty, it needs at least 4. 2 in the front and 2 in the back for passengers. We noticed a significant difference between the lower end models and our model with road comfort, and that's due to the upgraded 21"" rims. With less tire on the road, there's less cushion for a smoother ride, so while you feel more bumps, it's still extremely quiet. It has some of the best seats in the industry and has been great for long car rides. In the future however, we'll be not doing the upgraded wheels since we learned that makes a large difference in ride comfort. That doesn't affect our review negatively since that was a choice that we made when purchasing, but just something to keep in mind for future buyers. 

Gas mileage has been less than advertised, but it's worth it to note that both me and my wife are heavy on the foot at stops. We do keep the start/stop feature on, but forget to turn on eco mode on the highway which makes a difference. We also mostly do city driving which also makes a difference in gas mileage overall. When we're on road trips or actively trying to conserve gas we get an average of about 25, which is closer to the actual estimated. I feel that letting you know how we drive the vehicle makes a difference in why our combined MPG is the number it is and not something higher, which it could definitely get. Other than that, we've been extremely happy with our XC90 and can't wait to get our next Volvo in the future.

10/09/19 Update
We've still had no mechanical issues to speak of. Software bugs are rare now that they've worked out all the kinks, but we have noticed the bootup sequence of the touch screen has gotten painfully slow with time. This has been our biggest frustration.

Since I've written this article, Volvo offers a new service to add an additional USB port into the center arm rest just like the new models. So we added that to our vehicle. They've also just recently added the option to upgrade to the 2020 model year safety tech for XC90's in the 2016 and 2017 model year, so we plan on doing that as well.

Mechanically we've had no more issues since my last review. We're currently sitting at just over 60,000 miles.

Our warranty expired and we haven't renewed. Getting serviced without the warranty is really expensive. It costs between $2 and $250 every 10K interval, it's worth it to get the extended warranty if you're buying new. Don't buy into the warranty that the third party offers. Just buy into Volvo's certified or pre certified if you're buying used, it's much better. "

You will find out the since the XC90 T8 for 2016 is a brand new vehicle, they are experiencing  issues that they have to learn how to diagnose.  If you want to be a guinea pig like us, buy.  If not, wait of find something else.

This is our first and last experience with Volvo ownership. Period.

Update - This vehicle was bought back by Volvo for full price in order to avoid the Lemon Law actions.  Very satisfied that Volvo lived up to their problems and took the faulty vehicle off of our hands.  Still no chance of us owning another Volvo. "

I have 3000 miles on my T8 Inscription and could not be happier.  I drove BMW, new Audi Q7, new MB and Porche; the T8 is the true winner.  If you are considering a T6 or T8, the first option I would recommend is the air suspension.  It is a gamer changer offering a smoother, quieter ride and improved handling.  Going for the Inscription package raises the interior seating and finishes to an extremely high level.  Then of course Intellisafe safety features are wonderful.  And finally, if you are into music, the BW sound system is uncompromising.  Wow.

The T8 plug in hybrid's battery cost 50 cents to charge and it provides enough electric only miles for most of my city driving needs.  We charge between 1 and 5am using a timer to get the lowest electrical rate of 4 cents per kw (here in Arizona).  In the electric mode, the car it incredibly quiet.  Really magical. "

Beautiful inside and out, lots of great safety features, and a pleasure to drive. However, there have been severe software issues and most recently battery draining for no apparent reason when it sits.  Each trip to shop has been 2 - 3 days, because their technicians are not fully up to speed and/or the software is too screwed up. They generally have to do a remote consult with Volvo engineers..  As I write this I am about to jump start it to take it back to the shop again, just a month after the last battery episode (they did a battery reset and then installed a new battery last time, but never did find the cause).  Do a Google search and you will find dozens of other people with the same problem.  Another issue is quirky navigation system.  Usually reliable, but occasionally totally screws up destination city.  My recommendation.  Do not buy this car yet.  Perhaps wait a year until Volvo gets their act together. "

The ride is smooth and quiet. The sound system is great. The seats are the most comfortable I have every experienced.
So many optional items on other vehicles are standard such as heated, leather, power seats, huge moonroof, navigation and lots of safety features.
We are getting 27 to 28 MPG on the highway at 70 to 75 miles per hour in calm winds.
I am not a fan of the auto start/stop function and I prefer the Dynamic driving mode which is very peppy in city driving and disables the start/stop function.
I wish the car remembered the previous driving mode setting so you don't have to select it each time you start the car.
I also would like to see a Home Link option for opening the garage door. "

This happened 3 times so far! The panel also has tons of buggs and crashes very frequently. The brakes squeak! I took it to the dealer who are very helpful but was told the rotors are not available and are on back-order! several recalls so far can't count them!! I have a parking aid, the sensor doesn't work 9 out of 10!! I paid for it but don't use it!! The app has a starter that 9out 10 doesnt work and never starts the car!! totally unreliable!!

I was told that the car would indeed have to be towed into the dealership.  Also, since my phone was connected to the Volvo it wiped out my contacts due to a computer glitch in the car!  Since the car was in park the tow truck driver had to call the dealership to see how to override the transmission so he could get the car to move.  I watched as they dragged my car up the tow truck ramp.  I traded in my 2010 XC90 with over 100,000 miles on it and the only time it was ever in the shop was for service.

Very relaxing on long journeys.

Update May 2017: we got the software update to ""pilot assist 2"" and this is a huge improvement over the v1 system. Long journeys are now even more bearable!

Had problems with the electric parking brake locking on, stranding my wife in the school parking lot. Volvo said the car needed to be towed to the dealer; I found a discussion thread and someone mentioned pulling the parking brake fuse to reset the system (open hood, look inside fusebox cover to identify the fuse, pull, leave a minute, replace, done) - this fixed the issue totally for us. Going to get the dealer to check for a firmware update for that component at the next service.

Update May 2017: Have had several firmware updates, and tried switching the head unit SIM from the supplied AT&T to T-Mobile (easy job) but still we can't get pandora streaming reliably within 5 minutes of starting to drive. The touchscreen is infuriatingly slow and buggy, and the connectivity (not sure if it's 3G or LTE) is ridiculously slow even when showing full signal.

Update May 2018: The touchscreen is still awful compared to a Tesla. Apps are essentially useless, and the 3G connection is still awful.

The hybrid system failed last week too, thought the car remains fully drivable on gas. Waiting for a service slot for this to be diagnosed.

Update November 2017: Have had 3+ occasions where the car won't start (well, turn on). Foot on brake, turn the on/off control and ... nothing. We worked out that getting out of the car, locking it, waiting a couple of minutes and trying again usually gets it to start but wtf, this is just ridiculous. The dealer managed to replicate it, but not fix the problem....

Update May 2018: Eventually, after many more service trips, the ""car won't start"" issue was found and addressed earlier this year. The car powers up both on hydraulic pressure (from pushing pedal) and also from a switch on the brake pedal... it turns out that, as the dealership traced the wires through, that the switch input to the ECU was not clicked into place. After this was fixed, we have not seen the issue again. Finally!

Update May 2020: No issues since may 2018. Still very happy with comfort & performance. The touchscreen is still awful though... hopefully the next generation XC90 will address that. "

Thankfully, the car is under warranty but the hassle and the lack of confidence that this vehicle will keep our family safe is zero.  --We've had starting issues, navigation issues, issues with the transmission slipping and the latest incident where only the driver side door would unlock, meaning no one could get in or out of the vehicle unless we crawled through the driver side window. THAT IS NOT SAFE and since the dealership cannot guarantee it won't happen again, we are continuing to drive a loaner vehicle until they can figure out the issue.   It is a gorgeous car and when it runs, it is so much fun to drive BUT I'm now wishing I would have purchased the Audi or Land Rover.  Save yourself the hassle and wait until they get the kinks out of this car.  UPDATE:  The car ended up being in the shop a total of 8 times within months of our purchase.

To make it comparable to a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes, you need to step up to the Inscription trim and I would highly recommend it with the optional air suspension.  Without the air suspension the ride quality is average; with it, the ride is outstanding.  I had no intention of buying a Volvo, but was very surprised.  I drove all the competition extensively and bought an XC90 First Edition so it has every feature available.  The interior is amazing, the safety tech is unparalleled, and infotainment is great.  As for criticisms, the navigation system is not the best on the market, the car only has one USB port, and local mpg have been poorer than advertised.  However, on a recent trip from Phoenix to LA, we averaged almost 28 mpg.  I quickly got used to the touch tablet style interface and enjoy the ease of use.  I personally love the seats (heated/ventilated), Apple Car Play, heads up display, and the Bowers and Wilkens stereo will blow you away.  Again, safety features are amazing.  As for the competition, the X5 from the driver’s seat is a great vehicle, but it is smaller inside and the Volvo kills it in 2nd and 3rd row functionality and utility, which is what we needed.  The Lexus GX (keep in mind I really like Lexus and owned an RX for over a decade) feels heavy and sluggish compared to the Volvo.  The new Audi Q7 was not available when I bought and the older version was surprisingly tight inside.  The Merc GL is a bigger vehicle but when I optioned it out to match my Volvo First Edition from a feature standpoint it was over $90k.  The Volvo truly feels like a smaller vehicle than it is while driving and eats up highway miles.  My wife and I fight over who takes it each day.  I hope the long term reliability is above average.  This new XC90 is a giant step forward for Volvo! "

The vehicle is primarily driven by the wife and on family trips. We were not even looking for a Volvo at first. Previously we had a 2004 XC90 and while an OK vehicle we never loved it, size was good, handling and MPG were not. We downsized from that to a new 2012 XC60 which was also nice (much better handling and MPG). Although nowhere near the same luxury as our prior Mercedes. With two kids it quickly became too small. Was looking to upsize and considered the following 2015/16 vehicles: Acura MDX, Range Rover, Porsche Cayenne (too small), Audi Q7 and Mercedes GL. We have always been partial to Mercedes and loved all our prior MB's so it was looking like that would be our next choice. Took the XC60 to the Volvo dealer for an offer and that's when we saw the new XC90. This vehicle is nothing like the prior XC90, it is easy to see what Volvo has been doing with the $11 billon from Geely. I am not concerned with a Chinese company being the parent owner of Volvo, as the Swedes still design and build the car. Look around these days and you will find many of the high-end items in the world owned by someone else. 

The luxury from the new XC90 is completely on par with the Germans. The Europeans have mastered the art of that for years but always seem to lag in the technology arena. Even when they do offer technology it is not on level with what high-end Japanese autos offered; not to mention you will easily add $10k to the European vehicles with options and still envy what the Japanese models have. The XC90 is a vehicle exceeding at both. Ours is a fully loaded model (spec'd same as a First Edition) and in no category does it lack. The luxury from the 18-way adjustable (Inscription model) front seats to the perfect balance of Nappa leather, birch wood and metal accents leave no doubt every detail has been thought of. Should you even find a glove box that can also cool down to 40 degrees in a European car, rest assured it will be another pricey option. The place I could see an improvement would be additional USB ports, but plug in one of the adapters that gives you two USB ports per outlet and problem solved. Reading other reviews prior to our purchase that was also one of the few things people could seem to gripe about. If lack of multiple USB ports are the biggest complaints with the XC90, then I think Volvo has succeeded in their goal of making a new iconic flagship for their brand. The all glass instrument cluster and center stack is as functional as it is aesthetically pleasing. The tablet like interface is extremely easy to use and does respond instantly (was a big concern of mine). Want to test the responsiveness, adjust the temperature slide up and down, it responds as fast as you can move your finger! Looking forward to the upcoming update to include Apple Carplay and Android Auto integration. The heads up display is another feature worth getting, very nice never having to take your eyes of the road. The enormous panorama sunroof is something the backseat and even third row passengers will enjoy. Shutting the doors is a solid thud I haven't heard since our last Mercedes. Again every aspect of this vehicle we just love.

The drive is outstanding for this capable 7 passenger SUV, especially for a 2 liter 4 cylinder engine. It has better handling and performance than our prior XC60 with an engine twice the size. While it can't tow as much as the Q7 (the XC90 is rated to tow 5000 lbs) and is not as sporty as the Porsche or BMW, it is certainly a well balanced mix of comfort, performance and capability. The cargo space is seemingly endless (especially when compared to more sporty brands). It does offer four different driving modes which further enhances your driving experience. You certainly feel like you’re driving a luxury sedan, not a heavy truck or large SUV feeling about the drive. My primary car is a Porsche, and this is our first SUV I don't mind driving.

Safety is my paramount concern when purchasing a vehicle for the family. That is one reason I was originally looking hard at the Mercedes, but Volvo certainly knows how to build an extremely safe car as well. They further drove that point home with all the advanced safety features this vehicle packs. There is no need for me to go over all of them, you can read all about them for the next hour in other reviews. I will say they are impressive and non-intrusive. I absolutely love the lane keeping aid. A gentle steering nudge reminds you when you are veering out of your lane. I believe that is actually making us safer drivers all around because it brings to point when and how often you were drifting. Having that truly lets you know how attentive you are to the road and your primary task while behind the wheel.

If you are in the market for a luxury SUV, you would be remiss if you don't check out the new XC90. This one is nothing like any Volvo of years past for all the right reasons. "

Our dealer was nice enough to give us a Inscription for an over night test drive. We found the performance better then what I have read in many reviews, though the comfort in the seats was ok. I'm sure there are plenty of settings that we could play with to adjust the seats. While driving, the wife found operating the radio and climate was a little cumbersome due to the ipad like technology. Again, something to get used to and we were new to the car. Ride quality and steering was very nice, but the funny thing is my wife picked up on the tiny steering wheel as compared to her GL. Over all though, the car seemed fantastic and it's still in consideration. Our only, and it's probably minor to so many out there, is the climate package on the Inscription. This gives you the heated windshield which would take some getting used to. For me it was like looking out a screen door with all the vertical wires running through the glass. Again, not a deal breaker, just something to get used to. "

Volvo and the dealership have been nice so far, the reason i didn't say helpful because my issue has not been fixed. my suggestion for those of you considering this car is wait until the 2018 model, heck i don't think they have fix the break issue for the 2017s. i also wish that those of you that have gotten the vehicle do not experience what i have  experienced, it is beyond annoying and frustrating.

As stated in many reviews, it is an awesome, awesome car!!!  It is a BEAST!!!!!  Beautiful exterior styling, and very smartly designed interior.  The T8 Hybrid is a perfect combination of Eco mode (electric) for short trips, and power mode (gas) for longer trips (very fuel efficient engine).  Power is stunning ( not quite Tesla, but at a better price point), for a 4 cylinder (who would have thought a 4 cylinder and electric motor could punch out almost 400 HP).  Add the safety components, and this is almost the perfect car for today's market.

Great job Volvo.  You have hit the SUV ""sweet spot"".  The perfect combination of form and function.  I am glad to say I am one of the first owners of this great vehicle.  May Volvo find much success and thrive in the future.  The XC90 (especially the hybrid T8) is a thoroughbred.

Bought the car because of Volvo's safety and reliability reputation. Nice looking car and drives great. But still I would say Do Not Buy. Owned XC90 for about 9 months. It went to shop for three times due to unknown battery draining issues commonly seen by many XC90 owners. So far the issue seems have been fixed but I heard many other owners still have the problem. Stop/start almost never worked. Dealer said nothing can be found regarding to this. Received three safety recalls on the car in 6 months. All small but annoying issues.

This new Volvo hybrid drive train is not ready for prime time.  Its too bad as its a very nice car otherwise.

Update 4 years later: after a long series of trips to the dealer they seem to have finally figured it out.. the time they replaced the whole system did it.

So far I have put about 1000miles on the SUV, about 75% mileage comes from local driving - commuting to/from work, driving kids to school and other places etc.  I have yet to take a long trip or push the car to its limits.  Therefore it can’t qualify as a complete ownership review.  But for whatever it worths, I share my $0.02 with current and will-be fellow Volvo owners.

Maybe we start with some low lights

Sensus Touch Screen
Technologies are awesome, but also can be difficult to master. This is true in 2016 XC90.  Its central touch screen has 3 views to slide from left and right, plus a “car setting” view that is pulled from the top.  The screen navigation is complicated.  After two weeks, I still have trouble remembering how to get to certain settings. I tend to consider myself a techie and quite adept at picking up new things, Volvo central control proved that I am not as smart as I thought I was.

Key fab
It’s a classy design with leather wrapped around bulk of surface area.  It carries touch of a fine watch.   Function buttons are located on the either side, and that is where the trouble comes.  The buttons are small, difficult press and even more difficult to feel which is “lock” or “unlock”.  You will have to see it.  My key fab leather is blonde, matching the car’s interior.  However, Being in the pocket and rubbing against other stuff all the time isn’t the formula to keep key fab clean.  The key fab frame is aluminum.  My key has received a couple of small dents on the frame so far.  Volvo, if you are reading the post, please make the frame stainless steel.  The aluminum frame doesn’t match the leather wrap nor the $80K car price tag.

Park assist, Camera - bird’s eye view
My T8 comes with vision package, a great value and a must-have in my opinion. I especially love the synthesized bird eye view of the car.  I found it much more useful than park assist.  I, for one when equipped  with the overview camera, don’t have trouble maneuvering the car regardless parallel parking or back up parking.  Park assist, on the other hand, reacts slowly.  While I can see its usefulness for many, I only tested it for a couple of time before reverting to much faster manual parking.  BTW, park assist did work quite well when I used it. The bird’s eye view image becomes wonky when other tall objects are nearby.  This perhaps is the only knock on the vision package. I think it can be corrected via software algorithm.  I hope Volvo has a future software update for this.

Voice recognition 
Works about 80-85% of time.  The number might seem high, but in day-to-day usage, it is not very dependable.  Volvo obviously has some catch-up to do with Google etc in the voice recognition domain.

One USB port and no SD card slot

Dealer told me XC90 accepts micro SD card, but I am unable to insert the micro SD card to the slot next to the glove box release button.  No place in the manual refers to micro SD card either.  This interlude attests how much a dealer knows about this new vehicle.  And one USB port in this connected era spells major inconvenience for the owners.  I have to keep swapping between my phone, USB stick and passenger’s phones.

Having said all of that, there is a lot to like, or may I say the word love, about XC90 T8.  First and foremost,

Quite and Smooooooth
The twin engine combo has far exceeded my expectation.  The transition between the electric and gas engine is so seamless that I often fail to notice the switch taking place.   Thanks to the hybrid powertrain, the car starts with electric engine with zero noise and gas engine kicks in when more power is needed or cruising at high speed.  The result? no 4 cylinder whining at low gear.   the start/stop also works fabulously well in T8.  In many way, the car waltzes around with V8 like grace, smoothness and tranquility.  

Not only twin engines augment each other well, regenerative braking and mechanical braking work in perfect harmony.  I don’t believe any non-racing driver would be able to tell which braking is at work unless he peeks at the dashboard.

Power
I’ve not floored the gas pedal and rev the engine to the red line.  The car is still breaking in, I have to be easy on the throttle.  So I can’t verify the 5.3 sec from 0-60 mph, yet….  Even with that, XC90 T8 has plenty of juice at the low end, cruising around effortlessly with 5 people on board.  With a gentle push on on gas pedal, freeway overtaking comes with ease.  400 horse power brings about the reassuring feeling. While I won’t use it every time when taking the freeway on-ramp, I know all the ponies are there there to haul the heavy SUV when I need to.

Touch Sensus
Except Telsa which I haven’t used,  Volvo’s touch screen beats Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lexus etc. in my opinion.  The screen is clear under the direct sunlight and responsive to inputs.  It may be prone to finger prints, but courtesy protective screen cover and mic "

Not to mention it's much larger and much peppier engine.  My wife and myself also looked at the BMW X5 and mb gle and Audi Q7.  We found x5 to be very expensive and the BMW dealer by us has a horrible service department, but the SUV drove nicely and interior was nice but very similar to the Volvo but 8,700 more for comperable equipment.  The gle was a bit small and no third row, transmission was a bit rough when passing.  The q7 was very out dated, no technology features, no safety features, worst fuel economy, we have no idea how it was rated so highly, it felt like it was a decade behind the others.  We also looked at the Range Rover sport, this was a very nice SUV but over budget about 24,000 more than the Volvo.  When looking at the Volvo make sure you drive both regular motors we found the base t5 to be under powered and noisy.  But for a few grand more the t6 engine is very quick and the transmission reacts much smoother than my Mercedes Benz e350.  The fuel economy has been surprisingly good for a larger SUV about 24 mpg.   I definitely recommend the active cruise control and cornering head lights both are great options and the kids love the very large sunroof.  The iPad interface takes some time to get used to, but everything is voice command also and the dash board also cam be customized to view whatever you want.  If you send some time with it everthing including changing its colors are customizable, maybe a bit too much.  I wish the auto on off would stay on the last setting used like most European cars instead of turning back on each time you turn the car on and you need to flip to a second screen to turn it, just not ideal.  The seats are very nice and designed to mold very well to your body, much more comfortable than my Benz or wife's old x3.  Overall I have been very impressed and would consider the up coming 90 sedan over replacing the E class with another E class if the features and ride are the same for less like the xc90 is.

We paid very little and upgraded to full autopilot up to 80mph, which is a nice option to have when caught in traffic.  No issues so far, only regular oil changes and some computer updates. "

I realized that a lot of the gadgets and feature were already in some of the other Volvos, but the XC90 just take them to higher level. The XC90 drives sweet, I just have to get use to the engine turning off at every dead stop, and restarting when the brakes are released.
The inside is somewhat captivating, and there is more than enough room for everyone. Power outlets placed in strategic areas around the vehicle, and air vents are right in your face.
Update - 
After six months of driving the vehicle, some of the issues I have had has been software related. We had to visit the dealership at least five times during that period to get software issues fixed, some of these issues were serious, while others were not so serious.
Also the pickup/acceleration is slow in every drive mode except ""dynamic"", then it kicks assets. "

It was one of the first models, fresh off  the assembly line. It is a beautiful car. But don't let it's looks fool you. The first 6 months were great. Then things started to go downhill. The first thing that happened was the hood flew open while we were driving. Luckily we were on a city street and were only driving 30 miles per hour; this could have been a disaster. We had the car towed to the dealer. They identified a faulty hood release and fixed the body work free of charge. Next we started to notice that the safety system is too sensitive. We had 2 instances of the car stopping itself (braking) for no apparent reason while in city traffic. Again, disaster was averted due to low speed and traffic. The car also has electronic and braking issues. Out of the blue the brakes started squealing and grinding to the point that it was undrivable  (at 11k miles). Had it towed to the dealer where the front and rear brakes and rotors had to be replaced. While there, I asked that the software be updated (the dealer couldn't manage to figure it out when I was last there). They had problems with it. My car was out of service for 2 weeks due to an inability to update the software that controls many features of the car. A week after I picked it up I took it back because the brake light would not go off and all of the tire sensors were on. It's been there for the last 2 weeks and they can't figure out how to fix the issues.

However, it has had one electronic glitch after another-each computer reboot leads to a new issue that can't seemed to be resolved at the dealer (Volvo of Louisville).  The touch pad has gone completely blank, the temperature gauge can have wild swings, the apps don't work well- the latest is that when I start the car or first back it up in the morning, the radio changes from sirius XM to a Christian FM channel.  I have the beige Napa leather seats but the drivers seat has worn thru the finish and I await a new seat cover for a car that is 11 months old.  Unless you have much time to spend  at the dealer, I would not recommend this vehicle.  I tried to trade it in, at the dealer where it was purchased,  and was told I would have to pay $52000 in addition to turning in this vehicle to get an similar XC90 ($32000 is owed).  Shocking, right? but Kelly the manager said this was her best offer.  Do the math, my car is worth about $23000 according to this manager.  I would consider this extremely poor resale or an extremely poor manager.  Anyhow I'm stuck with an untrustworthy and overpriced vehicle for now.
UPDATE (March 2018):  Most glitches have been worked out except now my phone won’t pair with the car.  I opted not to pay for Volvo on Call ($10/month) so most apps don’t work.  Drivers seat cover was replaced but still stains badly and never looks good. It was deemed that the passenger seat was not worn enough to warrant replacement but it just doesn’t look good for a luxury car.  Would not buy this car again despite it’s great ride.
UPDATE: Sept 2018: The electronic glitches seemed to have been corrected.  Same issues with the seats- they stain very easily. I did take out the seat warranty but doubt it will cover.  The dent warranty didn’t cover a fist sized dent when I accidentally backed into an ornamental tree. Yes, the back up sensor was beeping but I was trying to avoid the basketball goal and didn’t see the tree! It’s still a great ride and I do enjoy driving the vehicle along with the satellite radio. "

Many of the problems were an inconvenience, but several of them actually made the car dangerous to drive. Volvo should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this model before all the bugs were worked out. The collision mitigation system was erroneously triggered on several occasions, which means that the car braked itself to a full stop while I was driving at speed and there was no accident imminent, the belt pulled me back into the driver seat and alarm bells went off, as well as the HUD flashed red lights. That was only ONE of MANY things that went wrong in the car. All of this with less than 3K miles. I will avoid Volvo at all cost for the rest of my life. "

It ended up being faulty transmission and engine mounts.  To reiterate what another reviewer said, the dealer had to learn from Volvo Cars of America technicians how to work on the car.  Our XC90 was in the shop for more than 2 months that we had it.  We are now giving the car back to Volvo but if we were to keep it, it needs a software upgrade and the windows screech all the way down and up.

The test drive was good. The 360 view, the dashboard were fantastic looking and I was blown over. Post purchase, I began to uncover lots of common sense things that the car simply refused to do. Unlike the Infiniti, the 360 view is not attainable unless you go through several clicks and swipes on the very cool tablet/ipad like dashboard controls. The purpose of the 360 view is lost totally. The rear view can be replaced with the 360 view but then you lose the range of vision of the road behind you. 
Radio settings are made unnecessary complicated. Another example, the simple and easy windshield wipers. You would think they would have these automated down pat but no. Unlike the Lexus, you actually have to tell it that it is raining only after which it does some level of automated speed up and slow down of the wipers.
The service was ""ugh"" and ""aargh"" always - condescending disposition of the people and poor time estimation at the top of the problems. A supposed 45 minute wait became ""a few more minutes"", ""half hour more"", ""15 more minutes"" to three hours! There was one time when the service person told me that car pick up for maintenance will happen only if I was disabled in some manner which was an outright cooked up story. The service people behave as if they are high and mighty and want to show that they control who gets picked up and who doesn't. A simple reason such as, ""We don't have drivers or cars to pick up at that time"" would have been totally understandable for inability to pick up. Lexus service was soooo much better! These are registered complaints and I received apologies. I was okay the first time but some issue or the other came up which did not have to come up.
The router and the wifi is not of great strength as advertised for sure.
The Lane Assist detected white dashed lines only. The double yellow line and the solid white line were totally ignored.
To top all of this, the car self-braked many times for the wrong scenarios such as a car coming on the opposite lane, a parked car in a turn and didn't stop for a stopped vehicle causing a head-on collision and was totaled after 6 months of usage.
In conclusion, it comes with a few cool bells and whistles but it is not a well thought through car for overall execution. Service gets the lowest score. Truly disappointing. "

That said, I had planned on getting something smaller, but the ride comfort and technology (especially the great center display and fewer buttons) won me over. It is bigger than the Highlander it replaced, so my wife and I are still parking in the back corner of the mall parking lot - afraid to get too close to anything that might scratch our new car. It is great onthe open road, but a bit too much around town, My wife and I are still learning the new technology, which is a bit intimidating to a non-technophile. My wife couldn't figure out how to turn off the radio the other day, and needed to recruit a youngster to help (you just turn the volume down until you see the ""x"") - oh well. Controls are a bit quirky. I recently went to a car wash and when I got in the vehicle, both mirrors were folded in. I had to call support from the car. Needed to simultaneously push both mirror buttons and they returned to normal - just something to learn. After owning the car about 2 years, I noticed it was running a bit rough and my highway mileage had declined. After reading the manual and related articles, I started using top tier gasoline instead of the bargain stuff. Apparently upper head injection can get fouled. Once I changed, the engine smoothed out and my mileage got better. On my last long trip, I get nearly 30 miles per gallon. "

Not the most technically savvy individual though still managed to work out the majority of the screen based functionality within a couple of hours. Bottom line is that this is well built, stylish SUV that provides an amazing level of comfort combined with a strong sense of safety due to the numerous features that you would expect from a Volvo.

I preferred the Benz, but this car was for my wife and she liked it better.  Between the two it is the better overall value option.  Ours has every major option except the trailer hitch and HUD.  Overall, it's been a good car, but there are some nagging design faults that really detract from it.  First up is the HUD.  I'm 6' 2"", and it was not possible to adjust the system to permit me to see it clearly; the top edge was always cut off, hence one of the reasons we didn't get that option.  Next are the seats.  They are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever had to suffer through.  After nearly a year of driving it I still can't adjust them to a comfortable position.  The seat bottoms literally pinch my butt on the driver's side.  On the passenger side my tail bone sits directly on the seam for the extendable thigh support.  The lumbar support in the seat back can't be set in a position that works for me for long periods.  The seats in our car are the 'contour' models (I think); maybe the 'comfort' seats don't have these issues.  For me, the 2nd row seats are far more comfortable.  My wife is 5' 3"" and she doesn't have any issues with the seats.  My recollection is the Swedes are pretty tall, so why can't they make a seat that fits a tall person?  The next item is the cruise control.  The controls are backwards in that a single button press adjust the speed up (or down) by 5 mph, while press and hold adjusts by 1 mph.  These actions should be reversed.  The infotainment/electronic systems occasionally glitch, though software updates seem to have generally improved their operation.  The most serious glitch, experienced by me and my wife separately, has been the emergency braking warning going off for no reason, accompanied by the automatic emergency braking.  This occurred to each of us on the highway.  Fortunately, traffic was light during both instances, and the action was momentary.  Fuel economy is, frankly, lousy considering the engine size.  We're averaging around 21-22 mpg in mixed driving.  The best we've managed was about 25 mpg on a 450-miles trip.  Our Odyssey's engine is nearly twice the size and that car gets nearly 30 mpg on the highway.  And, it's a larger car (and weighs the same).  Compounding the low fuel economy is the ridiculously small fuel tank.  18.5 gallons?  Seriously? It should be at least 20, preferably more given the lousy economy.  Volvo really missed an opportunity by not offering a V6, or bringing the diesel to the U.S.  On the plus side, the infotainment system is easy to use.  The ride with the air suspension is sublime.  It feels like a tank.  Fit and finish, and materials are first rate and every bit on par (or better) than the Germans.  The biggest plus in my book, though, is that my wife absolutely loves the car, so it's a keeper.

Update - Mar-19
We're nearly three years into the car now and for the most part it's been good.  Service, though, is obscenely expensive.  We just had the 40k service done and it totaled $1700, which included new front brakes to the tune of $700.  The rear brakes were replaced at 30k miles and cost about the same.  Parts alone were $500, which is absurd.

The light gray leather interior is impossible to keep clean; just looking at it gets it dirty.  The seats continue to be terribly uncomfortable for me.  Interestingly, we were given a loaner that had the standard ""comfort"" seats and they were far better than those in our car, so it clearly is the poorly designed ""contour"" (who's body, because it certainly isn't mine?) seat that is the problem.  We have had a few pretty serious failures that were, fortunately, covered under warranty.  First was the pump for the air suspension.  It seized and left the suspension in park mode (a low-rider XC90 is not a comfortable ride!).  Replacement of that unit would have been around $1500 if we'd had to pay for it.  Both front struts were replaced for low speed popping.  This was apparently a known issue with Volvo as there was a service campaign for it.  Most recently was the dashboard.  Ours is covered with leather and it start curling around the defroster vents.  That resulted in a new one.  Software updates continue to improve some of the quirkiness in the electronics, so that's a plus.    

Overall, I continue to had mixed feelings about the car, but my wife still loves it, so we soldier on. "

Mine has the stock sound system, which frankly is excellent, I wouldn't blow the $2,600 on the upgrade unless you really are a hardcore audiophile. The HUD option, which I would not have ordered, was in the stock vehicle they had, it is okay, but you can't see it with polarized sunglasses! So that seems stupid to me. The self drive mode cool, but likely won't use much, the lane departure nudging constantly is a bit of an annoyance, but I will give it time to get used to. Headlights are insanely bright. The Ipadish controls are a nice clean look, easy to use, and overall seems like a nice option compared to say the Audi's control system and their ridicules pop up screen.

It looks, rides and performs (when it works) beautifully.   However, mine has been wrought with electrical/computer problems from the get/go.   It routinely spits out warning lights on various systems from ESC, engine, 12 volt system.   It has been in for repair (i.e not routine mtce) in one year more than my 2006 Mazda has been in its lifetime.   I am in my 60's and have owned many vehicles and this one has generated more warning lights in its short life than ALL my other vehicles combined.  Half the time software update is used by the dealer as the solution to my problems.   They almost never know what the update is supposed to solve.   My navigation system broke down on a cross country trip and required the dealer to reboot it.   Even my Tom Tom can be rebooted manually by me.   Finally replaced the module for the electric motor that drives the rear wheels claiming it was dragging down my 12 volt system and causing all these spurious computer generated warning lights.   The car worked fine for a couple of months and then one day it was completely dead (12 Volt) wouldn't even unlock the car.   Dealer claimed my less one year old 12 volt battery was faulty.   It was replaced.   So today 3 months later a  new warning light ""12 volt system service required"" has illuminated.   My issues electrically/computer are clearly still unresolved.   I cannot recommend this vehicle for its poor reliability.
Update August 2018.
Recently my car has performed well.   The issues with the 12 volt system while not resolved are now manageable.   I have multiple vehicles and I am retired.   I have discovered that this vehicle cannot sit for extended periods of time (a week?), or the 12 volt battery will drain.   The car will either be completely dead or the 12 volt system drained to the point of bringing in computer generated erroneous fault alarms.   This drain is due to the continuous high drain from the on board computer even when  the car is not running.   I can prevent this by ensuring the car is taken for a run every few days.   I have also purchased a jump starter just in case.
Update Feb 11 2019.   Since I have managed to get my 12 volt system performing as expected , the car has performed extremely well. "

So when it came time to buy my new XC90 (T6 Momentum Plus), there wasn't much that was going to keep me from getting it.  Although, when I saw some of the reviews on here about software issues along with other ""nightmares"" resulting from new technology and bugs that weren't worked out.. I was a little apprehensive.  I decided to put my concerns to the side and take advantage of the year end close out deals and buy one.  I've been in the car for about 6 months now and have taken it all over Colorado and have been able to try it out in pretty much every driving scenario: traffic jams, countryside driving, mountain driving, rain, snow, icy conditions, etc.  After all of that I do have to say this car has been pretty much perfect.  My personal opinion is that other reviews about ""nightmares"" are not only exaggerated, but blown completely out of proportion.  This car's technology centers around safety, so if you're going to weave all over the road, drive it like a sports car, follow people too closely, or in other words drive like a moron.. this car is going to fight you (unless you disable the various safety systems) every step of the way.  I have slightly modified my driving style and find that all the technologies work as promised without any issues.  My first week of having the car I did have the auto brake engage when I was speeding up and getting too close to a car to change lanes but it didn't screech to a halt or anything like that.  It simply beeped at me and softly started to slow me down to avoid what it thought was an imminent crash.  It took me about a month to ""learn"" the car and adapt my driving accordingly.  Since that time everything has been smooth.  There are certain things that annoy me about the car that I do hope Volvo changes in the future, but they are minor issues.  For example, I love using the 360 degree camera as well as the parking features, but because I live in a busy city I don't have the time to stop in the middle of the road and swipe through 2-3 screens to select the feature i'm trying to use.  I wish they would add some shortcut buttons on the dash so I can quickly turn my 360 camera on/off or select a specific feature without having to swipe through a couple of menus first.  That part definitely gets old, but my overall enjoyment of the car as a whole outweighs those frustrations immensely.  It is extremely comfortable to drive, ride in, and it's a real head-turner to look at.  The gas mileage isn't bad, but I pretty much always keep the car in ECO mode unless i'm driving up into the mountains in which case I use Dynamic mode, and that makes the drive a real thrill.  I average between 19.5 and 21 MPG on a tank, and that is a mix of both city and highway driving.  When i'm going long distance on the interstate I average 23-26 MPG.  I do wish the fuel tank was a little larger, only getting 300 miles out of a tank before the gas light comes on means I have to get gas every single week.  Some of the other competing SUV's can get 400-600 miles out of a tank. "

We travel probably 18 weekends a year so gas mileage is important to us, but so is capability for off-road and snow performance. We researched this purchase at length. This car is beyond innovative. The interior and exterior design feels like a $100,000 car, not a 60k car.  Where this car shines: fuel economy, handling, long trips (the pilot assist feature is addicting), interior functionality, comfort, the Dynamic and Off Road driving modes are incredibly helpful when called upon. Where this car isnt great: ride, the ride is very busy and a little harsh which exposes some 'typical European car rattles' and will expose every Lego stuffed in a cupholder. This is a trade off to consider if you like the confidence of the handling on a backroad. The technology can be a little invasive at times when you are just out running errands, so you have to be willing to learn about it and use it properly or it will drive you mad. The only major complaint that I have with the car is the auto-stop-start feature which is way too overzealous to cut the engine off when you are at a quick 4-way stop or pausing to let someone pull out of a parking space. I am optimistic the software engineers will release a patch for this soon (hint-hint). "

It requires eyes off road to scroll through the dozens of options; the driver mode default selection does not work, it always starts in Comfort even if you choose Eco or Dynamic (I saw this complaint in a review from 2016 model) and in order to switch between the modes you have to find the roller ball by the gear shift and turn it just right; should have a button or voice command to switch 'cause when you're getting on a highway and need Dynamic the last thing you want to do is fish for it.  Finally learned that you can control climate with voice commands so that's really cool and helpful b/c again eyes off road to change fan setting or temp.  A few times I turned fan up at start and it didn't catch, wondering what that's about.  Totally don't understand the auto climate feature.  And the navigation is terrible.  My former XC70's nav was amazing but this one asks for Street Number, Street and City in one command and then can't understand what you say and gives a crazy place back.   Should ask for each one individually like the XC70 did.   I am hoping all the technical stuff in the car lasts and no glitches develop with software.  Positives include the driving assist that helps keep me in the lane-very effective, and the media system offers lots of options like favorites, etc. which is fun.

I have been searching for a replacement for my Honda Odyssey for a while. I have compared Acura MDX, Audi Q7, Mercedes  GLE, and BMW X5. Eventually, I decided to have the XC90 and have to say that it has exceeded my expectation so far. Initially, I was thinking to buy a MDX given I have had a Honda before and for the value. However, I think the interior of the MDX is not as luxurious as one would expect and with all the options, it is not that ""value"" anymore, so to speak. Sometimes, people may have experienced ""buyer's remorse"" wishing you have bought a different car. It never occurred to me. As I said earlier, my kids love riding in this car and I feel good driving the car. The security features are excellent and are one of the main reasons I chose this car. The technology is super and the touch screen central display is very good, simple, clean, and works. One may need take time to learn how it works, just like using ipad or iphone. My car also comes with the ""red"" key which is nice if you have younger ones driving the car (additional safety features like limiting the driving speed). The only thing it took a little bit more time to make it work is the ""Homelink"" button for garage door opener. The instruction comes with the car doesn't help much. I went to the ""Homelink"" website and downloaded the instruction for this specific car. It worked on my first try. I wish it had come with the car a separate sheet/instruction on how to program the ""Homelink"" button given this would probably the first thing people would do once they drive the car home. Overall, I am very happy and pleased with the car. "

Volvo was completely unhelpful in figuring out what was wrong. My car was in the service department for 60 out of the first 100 days that I owned it. Volvo kept telling me that they couldn't recreate the problem so there was nothing they could do. The service department at Volvo of White Plains was beyond unhelpful. They were flat out rude and dismissive of my concerns.  After several months of this problem, I went on the NHTSA website and found that several other people have reported the same problem. I then had to file the vehicle as a lemon under my state lemon laws. Volvo eventually repurchased the vehicle. This was the worst experience that I've ever had with a manufacturer.

Here are the problems I’ve had 1) leather seats separate from the foam and crease 2) rattling from base from the stereo 3) second row seat siding mechanism broke with routine use!!! 4) infotainment system is slow and frankly it sucks not having jobs or buttons for quick functions 5) headliner was loose upon purchase and made an annoying chirping sound.  how about what’s not broken? 4 cylinder is loud, annoyingly loud. Ride is firm without the air suspension (only option I don’t have). Steering is great, better than my BMW and it feels good in the corners. It drivers like a European car. Safety is obviously Volvo’s strong point. Automatic breaking already saved me once. Fortunately I can’t vouch for all the features working in the background. This is an amazing looking car. The inside looks nice till you look up close.  It’s a great car to LOOK at but for the cost (north of $65,000 with the option I have) it just doesn’t stack up to my BMW in build quality.

Eventually we ended up buying XC90 T8 Inscription with all possible options (MSRP was 85K, but we got good deal). Car is very quite and drives really nice and my wife swears for its handling. However I feel driving is boring. Acceleration is no where close to my Mercedes E350. May be I should not expect that but I want to let you know that don't get foll by 400hp rating. It is big/heavy car and you will notice it. It has about 15 miles electric only range and my wife loves electric only mode due to quietness (I feel it is sluggish in electric mode). in last 4 months I had to visit dealer twice. Once engine light came up and second because there is some rattling noise in center console. Dealer fixed engine light thing, but noise issue has not gone fully (it comes back only at certain speed). I feel it is due to air suspension and I have to live with it. I don't expect such thing in 85K car. If I have to buy again, I would buy T6, since it is 400lb lighter so will have better handling. T6 will be 15K cheaper too.

Now it has been one year since I have this vehicle. It has made two trips to dealer for various issues. One for temp sensor gone bad and another for battery cooling pump gone bad. It was also making creaking sound at center console which dealership fixed by putting some extra insulation. Now I hope everything is sorted out and just regular servicing will be needed in future. I have grown used to its driving characteristics. Driving experience is best at Sports mode. Everyone gives compliment for its looks. "

After owning the huge Mercedes GL, we decided on something a wee bit smaller but just as practical.  The two contenders ended up being the new Volvo XC90 and the Audi Q7. We had an Audi Allroad which we loved to drive, but the back seat was becoming far two cramped for our nearly teenage son. We found the same to be true about the Audi Q7, as big as the car was, there wasn't a lot of leg room in the backseats.  The Volvo XC90 had far more leg room in the backseats and was more comfortable to drive in for long distances. (SF to SD is 10 long hours.) And the third row was much more comfortable, according to our preteen. My hubby calls is it the perfect mom car, he drives an BMW X5 for reference, compared to his car I love the smooth comfortable ride and acceleration.  The seats are comfortable to be in for long hours of driving and I don't feel like I need to see the chiropractor after going over continuous speed bumps or bumpy surfaces.  He does find the find the contoured seats a bit confining at 6'4"" with a bit a girth on the sides and it did limit us to getting the R version which I really liked.  The only downfall is that our XC90 has spent a crazy amount of time in the shop. Not purely sure that is the cars fault though, as our garage gives a loaner, and sometimes I think it is just easier for them to get through the amount of work they need to get done on cars if they keep our Volvo a few more days. My husband does call me the Beta tester though. So far we have had our supercharger malfunction, which is always fun at toll booths that are slow down but please don't stop and accelerate like made when done.  Our battery went before a year, if your car starts doing really crazy things it might be time for a new battery. And our USB port stopped working, not good when you have preteens. But overall,  we have been really satisfied with the car. The only major complaint we have is that the back row is not electric, so it requires a bit of work to navigate the seats, including the middle row. We don't move the middle row around enough to remember exactly the sequence we need to work in to facilitate the seat doing exactly what we want.  It tends to get stuck in sometimes crazy positions.

They list functions in the manual that just flat out are not there nor are available.  Seems somewhat dishonest to me.  For example, Volvo lists how to use the egress / ingress function for getting out of the SUV and into the SUV.  However, when I contacted Volvo, they said this function is not available, never has been and maybe under development as a future software upgrade.  Not sure how they can put the option in print when they don't even have it developed.  Second example is the manual shows a 110v outlet in the center console for passengers in the 2nd row to plug in devices.   However, that was only available in their 2016 model, again, according to the email I got from Volvo.  However, the manual is titled ""2017 XC90"".  I have found two other functions that are not available in the XC90 US model but available in Canada.   One would think they would have defined that better up front.  Thus, owners beware, Volvo isn't totally honest in what is / is not available in the 2017 T6 in the US.  As for the car itself.  I didn't get the 4 corner suspension (I ordered it but for some reason (either dealer or Volvo error) it didn't come with it.  However, the ride is comfortable and about the same as in our 2011 Chrysler Town and Country.   Gas mileage is ok, I'm averaging around 22 mostly in town.  Best gas mileage is in cursing mode.  It really sucks the gas when taking off and probably is where it falls short a little.  Does have some great safety features but also falls short.  For example, the lane assist where it is to alert you if you drift to far left or right, is not reliable.  There are times when it should have alerted but easily let me cross the center line either having no notification or late in notifying me.  Hence a head-on-collision would have already taken place.  My 2014 GMC 1500 truck has the same feature and works perfectly all the time.  Not sure why a $75,000 vehicle doesn't have the same accuracy.  Pilot assist works as designed. As long as the lane markings can be identified, it does auto steer the car up to 80 mph.  You do have to interact with the steering wheel every 30 -45 secs however or it will auto disengage.  The scary part is that there are times when the system, apparently, looses the ability to see the lane markings and just disengages without any warning to the driver.  I would think, again, for this high end vehicle, it should alarm if the system is disengaging.    Thank goodness I have not had to test the auto braking if a car turns in front or to avoid a rear end collision.  I'm assuming it will work when required.  The active cruise adapter works well and you can set the distance (actually set the secs) within which you want the car to adjust the speed based on the car in front.  The seats are very comfortable but getting in and out of the vehicle is difficult unless you retract and lower the seat.  I'm 5' 10"" and if I don't lower the seat all the way done, I will hit my head getting out.  Climate controls work well as do the ventilated / heated seats.  2nd row seating is about as comfortable as in other vehicles.  3rd row quite frankly is limited to children.  Very difficult for adults to get in and out of the back.  Not adult friendly.  As with reviews of the 2016 model the lack of USB ports is a glaring deficiency in a high vehicle in this price group.  Overall, I'm happy with the vehicle but would I buy it again, I don't know.  I would look closer at the new 2017 Mercedes I think. "

There is great mood lighting, an excellent sound system, comfortable seats, classy styling, touch screen, AUTO PILOT (the best thing ever in Southern California traffic - I'll never buy a car without this feature again), parallel parking assist, second row seat adjustment for larger/smaller passenger leg room and much more.  Twice my car auto braked and likely saved me from accident, so thank you Volvo, but many other times as I am driving in a residential street it dings loudly with an orange bar code.  It falsely alerts me and sometimes even breaks slightly, that I am going to hit a parked car that I am no where near.  It scares me each time it does this.  My moon roof poured water in the second row of my car when I took it to the Costco car wash.  This fix (replacing the moonroof and making adjustments) took about a week.  I have had multiple issues with temperature control systems, both requiring extended visits (about a week each time) at the service shop, while they ordered parts and made repairs.  My seat belts, seats or whatever squeaks as I am driving down the road.  It's like nails on a chalkboard.  I've been in several times for this and now I just give him.  My quiet Volvo riding experiencing now has me twitching at the sounds.  I have continuous issues pumping gas (they made a repair for a check engine light on a fuel related issue, just not this issue) where the pump clicks off and I cannot tell if my tank is full.  I'm scared to keep pumping as gas will spill out, so I stop and fill up at another gas station or another occasion.  Volvo offered to buy my car back and it has been a very smooth process, so much so, that I will be purchasing a 2018 XC90 Plug-in Hybrid.  I am hoping they have worked out some of the glitches.  Fingers-crossed...

Update, 1/8/18!!!  I have been in my new 2018 Volvo XC90 Plug-in Hybrid Inscription for several months and I reached 3,400 miles before my check engine light came on.  What a huge disappointment! As luck would have it, my thermostat needs replacing (a 3-5 day repair estimate).  This is EXACTLY the same issue as on my 2016 XC90 Plug-in Hybrid.  You can’t make this stuff up!  Buyer beware of the mechanic/computer problems on this car.  They are real!  My service advisor told me that they haven’t seen this issue on other 2018 models yet (I am one of the first buyers in my location of this model year).  

Update:  June 2018, 2018 XC90 - Suspension needed work at about 10,000 miles. 

Update:  7/11/18 2018 S90 Plug-in Hybrid - Our family also purchased a new 2018 S90 Plug-In Hybrid a few months ago. At approximately 4000 miles the check engine light came on causing a fix to the you guessed it!!!  The temperature control system...  The car died again after the repair, literally, requiring it to be towed to the local dealership.  It took several weeks for all of these repairs while the very nice local service shop waited for return calls and updates from Sweden.  With the time change, this is an extremely inefficient business model resulting in multiple day repairs (often weeks with the plug-in hybrids).  We have now owned three of them, so all three have had problems with the temperature control systems. "

My wife does not drive it very much as she uses a vanpool to get to work. We did not spend much time exploring this cars features. We did realize after nine months that the car actually had a coin holder :( and that the door to the coin holder was stuck. Took it to the dealer Momentum Jaguar Volvo in Houston where I bought it from and explained the issue. They kept the car for a day and said they had to order a part to fix it and told me it will be a warranty repair. Next day they call me to tell me that it won't be covered by warranty because the door was stuck because of a spill. I explained it to them that we had not used the car very much and that's the way the coin holder was until we realized it was a coin holder. If they left it at that I would have gladly taken the car back. They took out the center console and wanted $400 install it back. When I looked at the disassembled center console I did see some spill on to the sides of the console but nothing actually in the coin holder door mechanism. It looked like the dealer wanted to just charge me $690 to replace the coin holder because volvo does not reimburse them that much if it was done under warranty. They even called volvo customer care and made sure I cannot preemptively talk to them and have it replaced under warranty. I even purchased an extended warranty through volvo for this car. And all volvo and the dealer wanted to do was cut corners by claiming the damage was caused by the spill when actually there was no water damage to the coin holder itself. They won't admit that it was defective to start with. All this for replacing a $90 coin holder. I would recommend people looking into buying this car to make sure what kind of service the dealer will provide after the purchase. Reade reviews about the dealer service department before purchasing, because most of the headache with volvo cars is dealing with dishonest dealers service department. Your warranty is as good as nothing because it is the service advisors discretion in deciding if they want to do it under warranty. They will cook up some reason to not repair even warrantable items because they can charge the customer more than what Volvo would reimburse them. "

DO NOT buy a new model year Volvo XC90. Our first 2016 XC90 was in the shop more than we drove it. Volvo ended up buying it back from us. The problems are too many to list, but range from dashboard and info screens going dark (while driving), auto park feature wanting to engage when stopped at a stop light, exhaust noises during acceleration, AC not working properly from time to time, the $2,600 B&W sound system who's speaker grills rattle more than anyone should tolerate and driver profile settings not working/syncing with the key fobs, acceleration is jerky and anything but smooth (we have the Polestar performance chip installed) and various infotainment glitches.

Now the kicker, Volvo wanted to keep us ""in the family"" and worked a deal to get us a new 2017. LOL, this one has the same issues and has been in the shop 5 more times, with one of those service appts lasting 4 weeks. Also, it gets terrible gas mileage (15 mpg city-20 mpg hwy) and the ride is so stiff it’s worse than driving my BMW with the sports suspension pkg. You feel EVERY bump and crack and not in a good way.  The whole driving experience is like a twitchy, nervous gazelle before a lion feeding frenzy.
Don’t believe all the reviews that paint a glorious picture after driving this SUV for a few hours. The designers, engineers and Volvo management should be ashamed of the car they approved and built
I wish we would have walked away after the first one was returned.  Now I see why the original Volvo company went bankrupt.

After owning this vehicle for three years, I can say with confidence that this car should be avoided at all costs. 
     The amount of times it was in the shop for ""software updates"" and even a leaking exhaust system was concerning, not to mention the woeful build quality issues my vehicle had. The rear driver's side door was not aligned properly, to the point where excessive buffeting occurred in the car at highway speeds. Moreover, all doors began to rattle in their openings on regular road surfaces around 10,000 miles. The 21 inch wheels on my car looked great, but did absolutely no favors for ride quality, even with the air suspension option. 
     The bad ride made using the Sensus system very difficult unless I was parked, and I have had experience using iDrive, MMI, CUE and Comand/MBUX systems from competing brands. 
The fact that nearly all of the most frequently used controls (climate control and seat heating/ventilation) were placed in the screen was very frustrating, especially because the screen is so laggy and has small icons. The lack of power folding second and third row seats, and even a power steering column adjustment was insulting, and I wish I had caught those missing features before I signed the lease. 
     Another huge design flaw was the placement of the rear climate controls, which would always be interfered with by the front passenger's elbow when they would rest it on the armrest. The bumping of the said passenger's elbow would trigger the fan to go full blast and create a lot of excess noise in the already loud cabin. The fan speeds in this car are not gradual enough; it's basically full blast or no air flow at all. I also had the joy of dealing with whistling air vents in the front row for the duration of the lease. 
     The Pilot Assist feature was one of the items that sold me on this car, but I lost all trust in it when it nearly pulled me into a division wall on the freeway with no warning. In addition, the front emergency braking activated on its own a few times in the last few months, when there was no imminent threat of an accident. I have grown to not trust this vehicle with my safety, let alone my family's. I am now happily driving a different brand completely. "

German Shepherd fits nicely in either rear bucket seat with thigh extender out. Seats are extremely comfortable and include awesome massaging. Auto park and brake set or release is great feature. Safety technologies all included and really like active lane keeping as well as adaptive cruise. More than enough room in back for shopping and luggage even with having an Fpace spare space saver tire in case of flat laying on cargo floor (nearly exact diameter vs Volvo’s spare is 4” smaller). About 31 mpg in 6300 miles which is incredible for a 5300 lb SUV with 400 hp. Charges in two hours at 240V so do it several times a day. Remote climate start is perfect for dog on hot days. A lost car glitch on nav map was easily fixed by resetting Sensus system per screen option. Air suspension lowers car automatically. The list of great features goes on and on. Highly recommended plus Volvo included maintenance for 30000 miles or 3 years. An incredible vehicle and highly recommended!

You know how some cars are better than the sum of its individual parts (VW GTI, for instance)?  This car has all the right parts, but, the vehicle made me feel like a beta tester - the computer which controls everything is too slooooooow - a trip for service had the software updated, but the computer got slower, not faster.  Too much intervention with touch screen required to perform the simplest functions, and it is slow to react.  The sensors go off randomly which flabbergasted me with trying to get them to just shut up!  The rear seat belts constantly rattle against hard plastic, which drove me crazy, too.  The dealership experience is not up to the standards of its peers, either.  The design of the car is beautiful, but it just needs more refinement to be competitive.  It is my fault I did not pay enough attention to the suspension during my test drive - my other car is a Ford Mustang, which has a much smoother ride experience.  Either pay for the upgraded suspension, or know it will try to beat you to death with the standard suspension.  I had such high hopes and am disappointed the car failed to meet my expectations. "

But this isn’t for those who don’t like technology or struggle to stay centered in the lane - this is made for those who love technology, like safety and design and are proud to drive something a little different.  The infotainment system does have a delay when it starts - it takes about 10 seconds.  The ride isn’t as plush as a 60’s Cadillac - I wouldn’t recommend springing for the 22” wheels - the 20’s will ride better (but don’t look as snazzy).  The 2.0 liter engine has almost 44 bars of pressurized air from the turbo and supercharger (that is a lot of boost) and per liter is more powerful than the Audi RS7 - in a family SUV.  With all that boost the engine has plenty of power - but isn’t as smooth as your regular non boosted v6 engine that dominates this segment of SUVs.  No, this is an SUV made for someone who enjoys driving, having an experience and can understand that some character is what makes a Volvo unique.  If you want a Toyota Highlander or Ford Explorer - go get one.  If you want a cool German SUV - get one of those.  If your values of safety, technology, being friendly to our planet and having a fun and unique driving experience matter - get the Volvo.  Plus - when that other driver runs a red light and moments before the impact are you going to wish you were in an XC90, the safest SUV made?

The only issue we had was at around 30,000 the check engine light came on and long story short we needed to have the injectors replaced. Fortunately it was all covered under the warranty. We also had an issue with a plastic handle coming apart on two separate occasions on the floor panel covering over the spare tire well.

I chose the hybrid mainly because of the added acceleration and the ride of the car with the air suspension package. I get on average 27mpg but have gotten as high as 40mpg in town. It would probably average in the 30mpg range if I remembered to plug it in every night. We don't travel in this vehicle and I normally put less than 10,000 miles a year on my cars.  I have been pleased with the interior.  It is luxurious and I find the seats to be very comfortable.  I like the simple and elegant design without all of the buttons and dials. My biggest disappointment with this vehicle has been the reliability.  My first incident occurred within a few months of purchase.  I got a Reduced Engine Power light as I was backing out of the garage to take my son to the Dr. which was less than a mile from my house.  As I did not need to accelerate over 35mph I decided to risk driving it which was, admittedly, a mistake.  As I was pulling out to cross 2 lanes of traffic the car just stopped and went into what is known as ""limp mode"".  Google this and read what other people have experienced.  It is very distressing to me that a car can just lose power and stop while you are driving because of what I was later told was a software issue.  I had to have it towed on a flatbed and the dealer kept it for about 4 days.  They updated the software and told me the issue should be resolved.  My next issue occurred last Friday. I was out to dinner and when I got in the car to drive home I got a light that said Hybrid System Failure-Service Required with an engine light on.  My husband chose to drive the car home but, once again, I had to have it towed to the dealership on a flatbed the next morning.  The car has just under 7,000 miles.  It was in the shop M-Th.  The dealership again reloaded some software which fixes the issue 60% of the time ""per Volvo"".  Volvo requires the dealership to try this first. If I continue to have problems in the future they will probably have to replace the IGM module.  As a side note, in both instances the dealership was unable to offer me a loaner and both times they had my vehicle for 4 week days.  The irony hit me as both times the car was being driven away on a flatbed my husband said to me, ""That sure is a beautiful car.""  I thought to myself, ""Yes, it is beautiful when it runs."".  For $75,000+, there are other beautiful and more reliable cars. "

It is a superb vehicle to travel in with the wife and dogs.  Highway gas mileage runs between 25.4 and 27 depending on how fast I drive.  The only time I have had it in the shop was for the 10,000 mile services.  Disappointing were the Pirelli tires which only lasted 30,000.  When I do trade I think I will move up to T8 so I can drive on battery in city fuel.  I think the new generation XC90 is probably the best Volvo built.  I would recommend it most certainly.

 

I, like many other owners of Volvo's have owned other premium vehicles and most certainly cross shopped for the best value, durability and drive-ability before purchasing a Volvo.  Having owned MB, Lexus and other vehicles I have always had a Volvo in the garage.  This is my 13th and can honestly say that for all but 1 have earned my appreciation for durable vehicles.  I have driven this XC90 for 6,000 miles both in good weather and bad and an equal amount of time in town driving and on the interstate.  The following are my thoughts and pros and cons: PROS - 1) excellent drive-line (don't worry about this SUV only having a supercharged/turbocharged 4 cylinder motor.  It is equal to or better than competitors 4 cylinder and some V6 motors ).  Very strong engine with plenty of on ramp and passing power.  Fairly quite even under hard acceleration. Shifts are smooth and it is hard to tell when the transmission is shifting.  I found the car to be very well damped and smooth even though I have the optional 21 inch wheels.  2) MPG is as advertised so their were no surprises there. 3) ergonomics are in a class by themselves as Volvo has always been known for their comfortable seating and the XC 90 does not disappoint.  Anyone owning German autos will know what I'm talking about because seats in MBs and BMWs are like sitting on concrete and become uncomfortable after a couple of hours.  Audi seats are a little more forgiving but not by much.  The closest comfortable seat to a Volvo is Lexus.   All controls fall easily to hand in the XC90.  Second row seating is comfortable with the seat backs ability to recline, plenty of knee room and the foot-wells are large enough for folks wearing bulky shoes or boots.  Third row seating is easily accessed but not much room for adults.  4) Infotainment - I found the SENSUS system to be intuitive and easy to use.  Take the time to spend a couple of hours learning the system and you won't be disappointed in what is offered in the way of information, audio, wi-fi, climate control (all three sections) navi, forward and backup camera's etc.  4) Lighting -  I really enjoy the LED headlights (swiveling) and fog lights angles.  The fog lights illuminate to each side of the vehicle extremely well.  The interior lighting is fantastic and I like the ability to change the colors as well as the strength of the lights.  Back up lighting is superb. 5) Maintenance - It is great to have service covered vs paying huge maintenance fees.  I have had the car back to the service dept one time for a software upgrade but other than that the SUV has been bullet proof.  No rattles, squeaks or groans in the cabin. No problems with SENSUS.   I call the cabin the ""cone of silence"".  CONS - 1) SENSUS -  sometimes can be slow to process upon initial start up.  It can take up to 10 seconds for the software to wake up and all applications to activate.  I wish the backup camera was not part of the infotainment system.  Volvo would be wise to separate the camera from the rest of SENSUS.  A minor irritant, but one nevertheless.  2)  We like that there is wi-fi connectivity but set up through AT&T was not an easy on-line process.  I ended up spending an hour or more via phone with a AT&T representative to get connected. Not much more to report at this time.  Sounds like I'm writing an ad for Volvo with so few CONs but truly for me this SUV is a delight to drive with no bad surprises.  Most certainly the best built Volvo I have owned.  PS: Friendship Volvo, Bristol, TN is one of the best Volvo dealers I have ever dealt with both stateside and while I lived in Germany.  Matthew Ratcliffe, sales associate, is fantastic to work with and the service department is exceptional (they have serviced 4 of my other Volvos) "

So far so good, but fingers crossed. My initial reaction as a former diehard Grand Cherokee owner (5 in a row) is that a I am very happy with my purchase. The looks of the XC90 really caught my eye, but the interior quality sealed the deal for me. I had reservations about the 4 cylinder, but a test drive alleviated my concerns that it would b sufficient for th size. While it is by no means going to be mistaken for an 8 cylinder, I am impressed by the 316hp output especially at highway speeds and would describe the output as a solid v6 caliber. My Summer daily driver is a Z06 Corvette so, the road noise, and ride comfort are fine for my tastes. I sincerely wrestled with the idea of owning a Volvo, but the exterior looks and interior quality rival other luxury SUVs going for 10's of thousands more. I wanted a car with better fit and finish, more 2nd row legroom, roof rack and the third row was a bonus. I looked at the Cayenne and Q7. Performance wise, the XC90 is subpar, but for the money I could not beat everything this had to offer. The dash tech is fantastic and I'm just starting to get to know the lane assist, adaptive cruise, and pilot assist features, and they are impressive. While the 316hp output is impressive, the 4 cylinder is a bit ""tinny"" sounding...with an almost Diesel engine exhaust note. The base suspension is a tad rough, and the cockpit is not what I would call quiet. Road and engine noise does come through. Again, with all that I'm very pleased in large part to the deal I got. I had the benefit of getting $2500 Volvo ""conquest"" cash and $750 from Costco, on top of an insanely good trade in value on my Jeep (month end, slow night). I parted with a v8, adjustable ride height, quieter cockpit and I'd argue smoother ride, but gained increased driver / passenger space, better interior quality, stunning exterior, smooth tech interface, 4 years of VolvoOncall (Onstar like), increased safety features and amenities. I'm looking forward to a road trip to get to know it a little better. The only complaints I have trouble justifying at this price point is no cooled seats and no where to put your sunglasses...other than in the armrest. But far from deal breakers. "

I purchased my 2016 which had 2 sets of brakes and 2 sets of rotors, a leaking sunroof, and multiple fails on electronics before Volvo replaces my car with a 2017 version. The 2017 version was great, except at 37k miles when the engine had multiple failures. One of them occurred downhill on a mountain with my family in the car. Terrifying. After a month of no vehicle and going through a lawyer a second time, Volvo replaced my car with a 2018. At 33k miles my vehicle began having transmission issues. They would temporarily resolve with computer updates and then go back into slipping. After speaking with volvo, they said it was normal wear and tear. I decided I was done. I was paying for a car that spent more time in the shop than when I had it. I couldn’t do it anymore. I’ve driven Volvo’s my whole life, but I believe since being purchased they simply aren’t the cars they have always been known to be. They technology and safety is impressive, but if the car has so many faults daily, can you trust it will be safe when you need it to the most? "

First, about the vehicle itself, one of the best 7-seater SUVs on the market.  In its class, the only competitor is Audi Q7. And to configure the Audi Q7 with similar equipment including full digital dashboard, semi-autonomous pilot assist feature, upgraded interior and sound systems, heads up display and others, the Q7 will run at least $5-8K more.  So in terms of value alone, XC90 is a more sensible selection.  I realize that even with the XC90 and in the R-Design trim that I have, it costs more than $71K out-the-door, so to some shoppers the value isn't the most important aspect of the decision making process. Then let's take a look at the various tangible advantages that XC90 offers aside from pricing.  First and foremost, the interior of the XC90 is in a class of its own.  The upgraded contour seats are just amazing.  It truly provides the best comfort in any car money can buy. Next, the center console design is fantastic with the large touchscreen interface. The only thing that can compare to it is the even larger and better panel in the Tesla Model X.  Some reviewers on youtube still prefer the button and joystick controls in the Q7 or X5, but I think it is just the matter of accepting a change.  After using the XC90 touchscreen interface for about a week, I found it very intuitive and it responds very quickly.  I don't understand some of the comments which claim that using touchscreen during driving is more distracting. The fact is, no matter which systems you use, the driver still has to scroll through numerous menus either with a mouse pad (ie: Lexus) or a i-drive type joystick (ie: Audi/BMW), and they are all distracting. I found that the touchscreen on the XC90 at least offers huge icon for most features and all you need to do is to swipe left and right between two large menus.  To me, it really cannot get any simpler after one week of getting familiarizing of the system. By contrast, I found the concept of a retractable infotainment screen in the Q7 is very out of date. A retractable screen like that has been a thing in the past since the late-2000 Cadillac CTS.   The final point about XC90 interior is the fit and finish. Every single piece of the interior materials is top notch and the simplistic Scandinavian design is great.  However, the cabin is not the most quiet for a car in this price range. It is definitely not as tranquil as the cabin of a Mercedes.   Now, the second part of the review is about the OSD program. I did it when I placed the order with Volvo. With the OSD, there is no negotiation on prices, everything is ordered per the price list. The listed prices for the car and options are only slightly, if any, lower than MSRP.  The kicker is that OSD waives the destination charge, which saves $995 automatically.  In addition to that, Volvo provides 2 round trip tickets from any where in the USA to Gothenborg, Sweden and a night of hotel for you to travel to the factory and pick up your own car.  You may drive your own car through Europe up to 6 months and Volvo even covers the cost of your insurance up for 15 days.  And when you're done with the self-driving tour, you return the car to one of the designated locations and they will ship the car to your local dealership in the USA with no additional shipping charge.  So buying a car and getting a free trip to Sweden, why not?  I particular like this shopping experience because there is no haggling. I know what I am going to order and how much I'm going to pay exactly.  I get to tour the Volvo factory and drive my own car to see a part of Europe where I don't visit very often.  Such a great way to buy a car. "

The system would be much better if commonly used functions like climate control had their own physical buttons.

We selected this car to be our family friendly car when we have visitors and when we go on a road trip. We replaced our Mercedes R530 with tis car. The R530 has a fantastic 3rd row seat that can fit adults (yes adults) in the 3rd row comfortably. So we wanted another SUV with third row that could eat adults. The Volvo XC90 came closest in this regard. The third row can seat adults not as comfortably as R530 but is not as tight as any other SUV with the 3rd row.  I have always owned BMW and Mercedes cars and I am very impressed with interior quality of this car. So I am not sure what the other reviewer is talking about a bad interior quality. We got the Denim Blue with Brown interior and we already got so many complement that how sharp everything looks. Also, regarding the instrument panel and center touch screen controls, I find it very intuitive for me and well organized. I do not have any issue with safety in using it because I have already configured all the settings and do not need to fiddle with them while driving. All the users complaining about the screen is because they try to fiddle with it while driving. So I attribute it to bad driver behavior.  So far, I love the car and it has meet all of my intial expectations.  I will try to update this review after few more months. "

I love the safety features and the interior. Sure, they need to improve few things like voice command, and some applications like the AC should be easier to access without the need to touch the screen. The ride is on the stiff side but that is how I like, this is not bad or good, is just the way some people like, true can get bumpy in some particular roads, but guess what, the Audi Q7 does too (less but does). I recommend everyone that is searching for a midsize SUV to take look to the Volvo, do not pay much attention to the “experts reviews “. There are bias. "

What is under the hood is another story.  It is riddled with repair issues.  I have already owned two of them because Volvo bought back my first one. My 2016 R-Design version had the check engine light on when I purchased it.  This recurred several more times and it took several more visits to the service shop to repair.  Then, my sun roof had a major leak, which I discovered after my free shower from the Costco car wash.  I had multiple issues with my temperature control systems and some repair on the fuel system, all requiring repairs.  Each repair, always took a minimum of 2 days (and those were rare). Most repairs took 5 business days, so I didn't have use of my car for well over 30 days. It only had 15,000 miles when they bought it back.  There were two issues they couldn't figure.  The seats would squeak when going over a small bump in the road (it sounded like nails on a chalkboard).  I had major issues pumping gas.  At certain gas stations, the pump would keep clicking off, so I couldn't tell how much gas was in the car.  One time, it wouldn't allow me to pump gas at all. It just kept clicking off.  I really liked the features of the car, so after Volvo bought back the 2016 I purchased two model years later, the 2018 XC90 T8 Inscription (also a plug-in hybrid).  I have owned it several months and at 3,400 miles my check engine light came on.  It has BEEN IN THE SHOP ONE WEEK SO FAR!  The thermostat needs replacing (please note the temperature control system issues on my 2016; shame on Volvo for not fixing this huge engine design flaw!).  The only trouble is the part is back-ordered!!!  The estimate for the part being available for purchase it another week and then about 8 days after that they should have it in the shop.  This REPAIR ESTIMATE ON MY BRAND NEW VEHICLE IS A MINIMUM OF 2 WEEKS, MORE LIKE 3 WEEKS IF I'M LUCKY.   As for the gas pumping issue...  It seems to have improved some with the newer XC90, but it IS STILL AN ISSUE VOLVO!  Furthermore, my seats are starting to squeak too! IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BETA TEST A LUXURY SUV AND PAY FULL PRICE, THEN THIS IS THE SUV FOR YOU.  If you have a life and don't have time to spend bringing your vehicle to the dealership, then I suggest buying from a different brand. "

Don't know if this is accurate but I think to pay that much in replacement/repair on a vehicle with less than 70k miles that was maintained with oil changes etc speaks volumes for its lack of reliability.  Next my catalytic converter went out and I refused to pay over $1200 to repair it since my state (AR) doesn’t have emission laws so I live with the engine light on my dash being on all the time.

They are extremely difficult to get a hold of and do not respond in a timely manner.  Their attitude is also in NO WAY customer-centric.  All I keep hearing is that everyone is very busy, that there is only 1 Field Tech in the region who can inspect the vehicle and basically I just need to wait until they are free.  I talked to 2 managers about the issue, one was more responsive but also not easy to get a hold of, and the 2nd manager's attitude was that that how it is and nothing else can be done.  He took no accountability for the poor service provided so far either.

In short, if for any reason you have a warranty issue that needs to go through Volvo USA, be prepared to have a horrible customer service experience.  It has been so bad, I won't ever get a Volvo again, even though the car itself is quite nice.  Shockingly bad service for a luxury car brand.  Would give 0 stars if possible. "

It checked all the boxes for a relatively kid- and mom-friendly SUV: easy ingress and egress, access to a reasonably large third row, ample storage, and excellent safety ratings. It's an easy driving, large SUV on a car wheel base, so it feels nimble and maneuverable, while at the same time offering the solid build you'd expect from a Volvo. We enjoy the true-SUV riding height and visibility of this vehicle, without the lumbering and bulky feel of some full-size, truck-based-chasis SUVs. However, the main distinguishing factor of this car is the unmatched style and interior quality and fit-and-finish. The open-pore, natural wood details in the cockpit are gorgeous, along with the stitched leather clad dash, buttery soft leather seats, and elegant and efficient control layout. I'm 6'5"", and find the cockpit to be roomy and comfortable with great legroom. The upgraded Bowers & Wilkins sound system is truly amazing and an audiophile's dream. The 4-cylinder engine is both super-and turbo-charged and makes the X90 a top performer in its class. I don't believe a more luxurious and high performance full-sized SUV is available for under $100k. We looked. However, this car disappoints in a few areas. Most of the typical analog entertainment and climate controls have been consolidated into the Sensus touch-screen interface, which is essentially like having a vertical iPad in the center of the console to control nearly all functions. Although there's a learning curve for the complex menus and deep settings options, it wouldn't be an issue if the processor wasn't so incredibly laggy. Especially on start-up, the touch screen is nearly non-responsive, taking up to 15 seconds(!) to register and respond to touches. The rear-view camera is slow to engage and disengage, and you're often stuck sitting and waiting for the Sensus processor to catch up to your commands. It is actually a big distraction, and makes it feel like it's a car you can't just hop into and go. Here's my list of other gripes with this car, some pretty minor: 4-cyl engine performs well, but sounds like a whiny 4; The two main performance settings are 'comfort' and 'dynamic' - while the air suspension is nice and cushy on the comfort setting the engine is a bit too slow and subdued. The dynamic setting provides a nice firm ride but the car is almost too jumpy and eager to downshift. If you test drive the car, pay attention to the various performance settings and see if they suit you. The Bluetooth connectivity is slow and cumbersome. It's a pain to connect media on your phone to the car. However, all said most of these are minor gripes. We've taken the car on several long road trips in all types of weather, including heavy rain and snow, and it's performed perfectly. If Volvo fixes the Sensus interface (more memory, better processor... whatever) I'd buy the car again without reservation. "

They discovered oil sludge and said it was due to lack of maintenance.  It only has 30,000 miles and the oil has been changed twice (per Volvo's every 10,000 miles standard).  It was just now due for the third oil change.  The problem is that our oil wasn't changed at Volvo, but at a local oil change shop in our hometown.  The shop that changed my oil used 100 percent synthetic oil, which is what Volvo calls for.  We live 1.5 hours away from the nearest Volvo, which is why we used someone local.  No one ever told us we were required to use Volvo, and that if we went outside Volvo, to be sure and keep our receipts.  So the manufacturer is now denying our warranty and we are out $2,900.00  After the shock of Volvo not utilizing our warranty, I began reading the manual.  The manual states it ""recommends"" to use Volvo for servicing, but it does not say it REQUIRES.  The manual also states that the warranty can't be denied if you can't provide receipts of maintenance.  However, they are still denying our warranty because we can't produce receipts.  They continue to say its lack of maintenance.  However, we were able to provide bank statements showing the oil changes along with maintenance that was performed on my car at an actual Volvo dealership 6 months after purchasing the vehicle.  After 7 days and two Volvo dealerships going to bat for me, the manufacturer still refused to honor my warranty.  It's absolutely crazy that the manufacturer wouldn't work with me OR the two Volvo dealerships who were trying to help me (one dealership in Dallas and another dealership in Shreveport).  Due to the lack of trust with Volvo, we are now paying my lease off early and trading my vehicle in on another car (not a Volvo).  We are doing this because any problem we have in the future, the manufacturer will more than likely not honor our warranty and blame any future problems on the oil sludge issue.  It's a shame, but it seems like the manufacturer finds any loophole they can to not utilize your warranty and make you pay out of pocket for repairs. CONSUMER BEWARE  "

I love the mix of leather, wood (with a matte finish), chrome dressings, all highlited with LED accents. Although the shiny black plastic area tend to collect fingerprints easily, which is why they supply a cleaning cloth (which you will use often).

The built-in child booster seat is convenient for when you have family or guests. The $3200 Bowers & Wilkins audio system is like being in a live concert, where, when you turn up the volume, you hear every detail in crisp clarity without it hurting your ears. If you love music, this could alone be reason enough to buy this SUV. I chose the hybrid option, which when you lease, you save the $5k California Rebate off the purchase price (as opposed to getting a tax credit when you purchase). I love that I can plug it in and get 15-18 miles of gas-free driving. It adds extra power that makes this 6600lb car move very fast. I also love that it drives completely silent on the Pure or hybrid mode. To me, this was worth the additional price. The instrument display is great and the main 9” Sensus central display is so easy to use and again, really thought through. It is so sensible and user friendly, I am very impressed. Apple CarPlay works great, as does the Bluetooth option. The XM radio is amazing and it has a Spotify app that uses the AT&T modem, if you sign up for data service. I’m using the trial and have had a few issues with it buffering, as there is no option to download a playlist, like you can on a phone. I think that I will probably just use my iPhone with Spotify instead of paying for another device ($10/20 per mo). One last note, the safety features are the best available. I love the auto steering that helps you stay in your lane during normal everyday driving. It watches the road lines and applies corrective steering automatically if you start to drift. The heads up display is great too. It gives you a warning if you are driving too close, or if it senses a forward collision (which It sometimes falsely does on curvy roads). It displays the current speed limit and warns you if you drive faster (you can adjust the warning speed too). These features help you to be a better driver. Overall I’m so impressed and happy with my purchase. I sold my Porsche 911s to buy this vehicle and I would never go back! I also, love that there are not tons of these cars on the road and when friends hear I bought a Volvo, they don’t have any idea how amazing it is. Everyone already knows that Volvos are the safest cars in the world, they just don’t expect them to be this exceptional. "

I am a disabled Veteran who needs a stable suspension. My xc90 hybrid has air suspension. I do not think it works half the time. The transmission slips. When I cut the auto off the motor fan makes a loud sound as if I was pushing on the gas in neutral. I hate I had to spend so much money through military sales to buy the auto. A lot of the components are plastic. The dealer replaced a plastic vent cover. Looks like something you get from Walmart.

Working with internet sales at the dealership instead of showing up was where we got the best price. Our local Darrell Waltrip Volvo had the best sales rep but absolutely worst pricing and their manager was extremely difficult to deal with on two separate occasions. I will avoid ever buying a car there. But the car technology is off the charts and it’s elegant without being overly busy like some other cars. The ride is as smooth as a bottle of Col. E.H Taylor single barrel bourbon with the sophistication of a Johnnie Walker Blue Label. Our 7 yr old loves the built in child seat, and our 14 yr old loves the Bluetooth and Apple car play.

I previously owned an Infiniti Qx80.  Comparatively, I miss the luxury, space and comfort of the Qx80 and traded in for this car because my Infiniti was coming out of warranty and I wanted something with tighter handling, smaller and much better mpg.  Well, I'm very surprised that my xc90 T5 is averaging only 17 mpg.  My enormous Infiniti got a dismal 14mpg, but for 3 mpg's I'd take the Infiniti back.  Not sure why the mileage is so bad- I even drive in economy mode often, and the car's motor shuts off every time I come to a stop light.  Regarding the handling, it's definitely tighter and 'zippier' so at least I achieved that.  But I could've achieved that with any number of less expensive vehicles. The cabin feels tight, espeicially the front seats and I can't seem to find a seat position that is comfortable. Maybe I'm too tall? I'm 5'10"".  Idk, but definitely having a bit of buyers remorse...

I looked at the manual to see if it tells you that you cannot use a trunk mount bike rack. Not only does it not say that you can't use a bike rack, it actually warns you that a trunk mount bike rack may interfere with the rear view back-up camera. Volvo has flatly refused to do anything about the damage and the dealer has given me the name of a bodyshop who apparently does a lot of work on Volvos.  I have also noticed that the quality of the paint or gelcoat is very poor. The electronics are constantly malfunctioning. They replaced my entire ""module"" (electronic dash panel?) within 5000 miles. I had to take it back again for more malfunctioning electronics.

Wonderful interior, nice exterior styling. The electronics and safety are impressive. But... whoever designed and engineered the drive train was misguided. The 14 mile all-electric range is a joke. 8 miles at best. The gasoline powered range is laughable. 13 gallons fuel capacity. The T8 is really a front wheel drive vehicle with an electric rear wheel drive assist. I cannot imagine what the range would be if you were towing a boat or had something mounted on the roof. It is probably well suited for someone who lives in the city, drives the kids to school and goes to the market. With the short electric range, you will find the gas engine is virtually always needed and thus you are just hauling around an extra 500 lbs. of spent batteries. But with a full charge, this vehicle is fast from a standstill. Only two negatives about the rest of the car: The front armrests are too short for tall drivers and the ride with the optional wheels and tires is a bit rough, even with the air suspension. Positives are many, but this is a very expensive vehicle once you start adding options. Many dealers are selling them at or below invoice. The extra $5002 in tax credit would be appreciated, but the T6 is a much better value. BTW. I am probably getting another X5 diesel. "

First, it is nice to drive when it works, but honestly it feels like Volvo just threw this out here and didn’t really test it. It’s been in the shop every 3 months for electrical problems, or driving issues, I go through breaks and tires like I own a Lamborghini, and I don’t drive it that much. Not to mention the manufacturer promised me an extra warranty when I purchased due to my former ownership with VW but that’s my personal beef and nothing to do with the actual car.

To be honest after have other great brands, this is by far the worst SUV I ever had, all the technology involved (for which I purchased) is really hard to take advance of it, I mean the safety features might be great but inside the car the way they felt is another history.
 
Control Panel: Zero intuitive, very difficult to use them. With 2nd largest display in the market (after Tesla)  you really really expect to work just fine.  I consider my self a tech person and I use all the features and they are definitely not friendly, you can only use one at the time, cant mix audio with air condition for example, because there is all integrated.

Voice navigation:  is by far the worst on the market, better not to have at all, 5 or 5 times is unresponsive and failed, after 2 system upgrades directly from Volvo is definitely something with the way it was designed, the only way I found to make it work is to send the address directly from the Volvo on-call app to the car directly, which never let you ask for an address directly.  FYI (I updated maps from Florida in full).

Seating: Front row seating are another failure by far the hard as a rock,  and impossible to set up, basic lumbar features for a 55K SUV.

Climate: Very poor in terms of vent power, and again difficult to get to the controls directly.  (Included in screen panel only)

Volvo on call: This system allowed you to start your car from the phone, service is included in the 39 lease term, but you can only use 2 times per day (???)

Gas Consumption: 
In terms of engine seems to be powerful (mine a 2.0 turbo, 4 cylinders) but consumption is very high for a small engine like that , in my case city commuter , less than 18 per gallon.

Service on Dealer:  Service people very diligent and pro costumer service, I can not say the same from General Sales Manager, Carlos Sacasas (Volvo Carsf North Miami), that will treat you in the worst way, like you are not worth it as a client for them STAY AWAY!!

I already have it for 200 miles enough to know that this car won’t last in my hands for the full lease term (already searching for options to change) "

I can honestly say that this is the first time I have been really disappointed in a new vehicle after only a few weeks of ownership. Many of the things I don’t like could have been made more owner friendly with little or no  extra effort. The car is difficult to get in and out of. With the power seat and steering wheel, it would seem that the easy entry function present in most other cars in this class would have been included. It would also seem that things like cruise control ,lane guidance  and driving mode  could be included in memory functions for each driver rather than having to reselect them each time you enter if you don’t like the preselected settings..At service, the dealer says that Volvo recommends tire rotation, but doesn’t cover the $30 charge. I have talked with the dealer, and the Volvo phone line, but there doesn’t appear to be a solution other than look for a new vehicle.

This is a huge hassle if I want to send my kids out to get in the car or am carrying an armload of stuff to toss in the backseat.  Unlocking the doors using the fob isn't much better as the doors will re-lock within 2 minutes if not opened promptly.

When I unlock my car I expect the the car to be unlocked.  I don't need Volvo to worry about my security or second guess my choices for me.   A lot is expected from a vehicle at this price point.

Edmunds sent me an email asking me to update my review now that I’ve owned the car for awhile.  I am happy to update it, but I wish I had a more positive update to offer.   I am now at 40,000 miles and beyond my 3 free maintenance services, which came with the car when I bought it.  Volvo is telling me that is a $750 service - ouch!   The car has taken on additional little rattles from when I first bought it.  It’s not terrible, but is noticeable.  Overall, I don’t have the same level of optimism that this car will last as long as the 2009 Lexus GX 460 I bought new and kept until 2017.   I’m not unhappy that I bought this car, but I also don’t think I’d buy it again.  The instrumentation cluster alone is enough to cause me to have an accident from it not working the way I expect it to while driving.  Overall, while the ride is just ok, the user controlled technology has a lot of room for improvement. 

This car has everything going for it for a guy who loves the ride and feel of an SUV - a smart bold, masculine look; a super comfortable and well-appointed interior; and decent gas mileage.  It even has some pep to it even though it’s a 4-cylinder...AND it’s not outrageously expensive.  So why then isn’t this the best selling SUV on the road?   I’ll tell you why.   It’s that damn infotainment system.   The computer that runs it, as well as pretty much every other aspect of the car, is extremely difficult to use and is incredibly slow to respond.  In today’s age of technology advancements computer flash memory makes consumer’s expectation on responsiveness to be instantaneous.  In this car it’s so slow that I’ve almost gotten into car accidents trying to monkey around getting things to work.   Whether it’s my iPhone integration, which is so darn confusing when you turn off the car, or whether it’s just trying to get the right radio station to work correctly in conjunction with the sound, this car becomes a major headache.    Again, the car itself is not a bad car, but the inner workings are so hard to deal with my frustration has boiled over a number of times.  Knowing what I know now I would have bought another Lexus and I know those cars aren’t perfect either. "

I didn't know what it was until several times that I tried to pull out into traffic and it lost power on me. I had to step on the gas hard to get the car to move. Then it leaked transmission fluid all over the garage. Volvo repaired it, and then it had to go back in 2 more times because they couldn't get the gasket fit correctly to stop the leaking. Upon the last time at Bob Smith Volvo in Calabasas, CA, the service department returned my car with a huge dent in the rear passenger door.  Of course they took responsibility, but it took over 2 weeks for them to repair it.  Volvo is good about giving you a current model Volvo as a courtesy car, and I've been able to drive every one of their different models. After driving the XC40 for several weeks (of course while paying a lease on a $90K car), I realized how bad the brakes are in the XC90 T8, they do require quite a bit of brake petal force in comparison to all the other cars. In the past 2 months, my XC90 has been in the service dept for 28 days! I can't take it anymore. I didn't want to believe Consumer Reports when they rated Volvo as terrible in Reliability, but they are not so wrong. I have never had more problems with any other vehicle I have ever owned. And It's not like I bought a cheap Volvo, in fact, just the opposite, I bought their best one, fully loaded. And now I understand why more people are not buying these cars. It's really sad and disappointing. I spent over $41K to drive this car for 24 months and now I can say for sure it was the worst car I have ever bought.  "

By the end of the week, my husband picked out the perfect car with the bells and whistles. I got the T5 though because I'm not driving fast in carpool waiting for my kids to get out of school, so why spend the extra $10,000. Anyways, I bought it in February 2019 and it has had several issues. The small activity key failed and died after a month of use. We were left stranded in a parking lot until some friends were able to break into our house to find the regular keys and bring them to us. The sunroof would not close due to a computer sensor malfunction. They could not fix my until the following week, so I had to drive around with a hole in my car. The car completely turned off while moving through an intersection. After restarting, we were able to continue. The fuel injector broke, but at least they gave me a courtesy car. Most recently the auxiliary battery died and had to be released. Reliability is not this car's strength. "

I had a 2017 T6 Momentum and just swapped it out on lease for the 2019 T6 Inscription. The new one has the air suspension. Absolutely you want that option! Way better than the standard suspension. The vehicle, despite the 4 cylinder, has plenty of power, a little turbo lag, but not much. Put it in ""dynamic"" mode and it really goes. Don't waste your money on the $3,200 Bowers and Wilkins sound system, the Harmon Kardon system that comes standard on the Inscription is really awesome as is. Two things that you should be aware of: A. the Heads up Display disappears with sunglasses on unless you have gray aviator lenses. B. The IPad like infotainment system looks really nice and works well. But, it is a distraction in traffic when you need to change something. You have to physically touch it or swipe to change something, which requires you to take your eyes off the road. I would prefer if they added a knob to make the changes like Audi or BMW has. If you can afford it I would opt for the Inscription package. Nicer seats with massage and A/C, nicer trim, wheels etc. Better sound system, etc.    "

Traded in my wife Mercedes E350 for the T6.  Some say the engine is not powerful - it is powerful - yeah its a 4 cylinder and sounds like it but it works well.  If you want a better sounding engine look elsewhere but that is not the reason for buying the car.  Yes the infortainment system or lets say the Volvo's iPad contains many (most) functions and there is a learning curve but a short one.  Once one understands it - it is a breeze to use but if you are one that has trouble with your smart phone then this is not for you.  Bottom line the ""iPad"" works great and it is easy to use.  It is QUIET - thankfully it has all the safety bells and whistles because I might fall to sleep as it is so quiet especially with the seat massager on.  It is luxurious with its Nappa leather Volvo seats - these seats are the best.  I have had many Volvos and every seat was great. I prefer ""Zippy sporty"" cars however I really appreciate the relax peaceful yet accurate driving XC90.  Get the Air Suspension it just smooths out the ride otherwise the ride is very European which I find very nice also but others may find to ""sharp"" on our american roads.

Just last year the first volvo parts disributuon center in America opened. 

I drove the car hard as an uber driver. Loved the looks and handling when i bought it new in 2016. 

All services that rate cars have this Volvo near the bottom in reliability. Do not mistake great safety record over the years with reliability. Checking around with owners of Volvo brand, i got a mixed bag of reliabilty issues. But man the garage is always full doing reoairs in two Chicago Volvo locations. I know as i was there often.

Volvos have a histiry of being leakers. The sun roof - the pilars specicly. Although i also had drios abivevthe visir. Know that if you put off fixing it thn you could run out of time fir fuxing it on the warranty. You csn get a puddle in the back right corner of vehiclr. Under the bumper is the modular which meaures the oil. Which is done through instrument panrl in car - no popping the hood. The modular gets the rain water ftom roof pillars and it fries out.

I had problems with a transmussion line. First probkem with this Volvo in Noryh Ameruca so they were on phone to sweden. Also problems with fuel filter - twice. The has release pressure mechanism on side of car had to be replaced once too. Parts came over on a slow boat from sweden as the first parts facilty in America was yet to open.

The rough ride over bumps is truthful reporting. I had problems with ruders breaking or jamming the spring in the track to move the second row of seats - this is not on Volvo though.

The traction control switch to sport control is awesome. Realky ferl the difference..i liked the aacceleratiin. 

Overal i loved the looks but became disenchanted with the car breaking down often and the dealership having to wait on parts. This is a caveat emptor - buyer beware. "

I had the same model for the last three years leasing, I am well familiar with the car. The front and side sensors are not working, engine alarm signal, etc.
I called the Volvo agent, they kept my zero cars for repairs. The Volvo agent refused to give me another new car or just cancel my lease.  They rent a fan for my use till they repair the car which should be on zero.
Anyhow, for your safety, do not buy this Volvo XC-90. IT IS THE WORST!
My XC-90-T6 2019 with zero miles has malfunctioning Transitions and non-working sensors.  I had the same model for the last three years was good, but my recent lease from Manhattan Volvo was terrible. On my way home the car stopped while I am at the driving mode on most of the traffic lights, terrible feeling that scares me seeing the cars drive towards you and your new Volvo is not running. Volvo is no longer safe, what is more, important than your safety? Volvo even calls back a half-million cars they produced and are not safe https://www.euronews.com/2019/07/20/volvo-issues-recall-notice. My advice do not waste your money and buy Volvo for your safety.  Manhattan Volvo dealer refused to terminate my few hours leasing or replace the malfunctioning cars.  I am paying the lease and I do not have a car it is in Volvo Manhattan workshop, I do not recommend both of Volvo Manhattan or buying a Volvo car. "

Eventually I found alternate cheaper tyres with an excellent rating half the price of the Scorpions. The main gripe I have is with Park Assist, it’s incredibly touch and go and the most annoying thing about it compared to the far better version that BMW system 7 has is the fact it can’t factor in the curb location. So on my 2016 volvo you have to control the braking and speed and where you stop to allow for the curb, so volvos park assist on does the steering and therefore 50% of the job. The first time I used it I didn’t know about the fact it couldn’t detect the curb and I scuffed the brand new alloys, which I thought was the whole point of it! So it’s a waste of money in the Volvo but worth it in the BMW system 7 version. The other gripe I have relating to the wheels and parking is the diamond alloys; the tyre wall is not proud enough from the alloy so they scuff far too easily and being diamond cost you a fortune to repair. I would have much rather had steel alloys that were cheaper to repair or alloys that allowed the tyre to be proud by say and inch so you could at least reverse into a curb without scuffing. At 2.5 years I’m so 3.5 years actual on the car it’s done nearly 25k miles and it’s developed some EV fault which it’s in for now. Putting my foot on the accelerator pedal in Pure or Hybrid mode The car just loses power and it’s dangerous pulling away out of junctions for instance so I have had to drive it in Power mode only to avoid it. There were no warning lights and apparently it’s due to the pre-charge system. We’ll see what this ends up costing me! Overall it’s a great car though and I think the infotainment and controls are pretty good actually and simpler than BMW’s system 7 although far less exciting. It’s more obvious how to plugin in your phone and use say Car play. The ride in mine which has the air suspension is really comfortable and the seats are nice. The rear ISO fixes are in the right place so when getting my 3 year old twins in and out I’m not bending in much to get them in their seats, compared to say the 2020 X5 where the isofix bars and seats are further in From the door so you’re bending in which is far less comfortable getting your kids in their seats. The transmission on the car is pretty unresponsive compared to say a n X5, the paddle shifts whilst changing gear have quite a latency and the engine breaking is pretty non existent so the paddles and manual driving option serves no purpose on the Volvo, whereas on the X5 you can do fun hill descents and really get the benefit of semi manual and paddle shifting. In the Volvo you don’t! It’s not a drivers car like the Beamer, it’s just a great family car with no driving excitement bar the odd booting it at lights in Power mode, but that’s as far as the fun goes. The Bowes and Wilkins stereo upgrade I have is epic and I love the sound as a musician. The automatic LED lights are fantastic as well. The windscreen washers aren’t great as there’s not enough juice and power of water hitting the windscreen and mine doesn’t seem to have rain sensor which I had on my previous X5 and loved along with soft close doors which wasn’t an option on the Volvo, I believe. The 2016 door bins are too small for drinks bottles but the centre cup holders are good, ideally would hold various sizes though. The 3rd row seats were far better than the Q7 or X5 and can more easily accommodate adults. I wish they had put isofix in the front passenger seat and even the centre second row seat so you could still get people into the 3rd row, as you can’t without them either climbing in through the boot or trying get around the child seats which is bad news and not possible for teenagers or adults. Plus my wife has to climb regularly through to the back from the front to sit between the twins in the second row and then struggles to get out! Overall verdict, if you have a big family and a large dog, get one. If you don’t and want an exciting large SUV to drive, don’t and get an X5. "

The buying was a special remotely arranged one to avoid the typically horrifying day of haggling and lies at the dealership, but I went with overseas delivery to have no-haggle pricing and a preferred buying experience. The customization to my needs and wants was complete. Seller communications were completely confidence increasing and the ownership experience has been even better.

So much has changed since our 2013 XC90 was manufactured. Compared to the previous interior, Volvo has truly stepped up the design and you now feel like you’re in a true luxury car. The seats are very comfortable, the leather is supple and the inlays and trim are elegant. The shift knob is made of Swedish Crystal which is an elegant touch.

The exterior styling is, in my opinion, at the top of the competitors...not to rounded off and not too boxy. The grill has been refreshed slightly and looks elegant without being too gaudy like some other manufacturers.

Pure electric mode gives me a range of over 20 miles which is perfect for trips to the store and back or to drop off the kids at school. Compared to solely electric cars, acceleration is sluggish in pure electric mode. Put it in hybrid mode and it is remarkably quick.

The primary reason I bought this car was to keep my family safe. Google the independent crash tests by IIHS and compare to the BMW or Audi and you can see for yourself the design of the XC90 is safer. Volvo also has a marketing video touting the engineering that went into making this the safest SUV in the road.

I’ve owned Audi’s, BMW’s and Lexus vehicles and this is, hands down, the best car I’ve owned. It perfectly balances styling, eco-driving, and comfort without making a sacrifice for safety. 

The only negative I will mention is the passenger cup holders in the six seat configuration seem like an afterthought and will likely be broken by my kids...but that should not stop anyone from seriously considering the 2020 XC90. "

Both of our previous Jeep has had this as standard as do many cars at half the price. We recently had a low tire and you just get a warning light and not the actual tire pressure. Something we had on our last to GC's and for that matter I remember my 1998 Corvette having it. Having the actual pressure can help you make the safest decisions as you deal with the issue.  The pilot assist is not up to par with that of a VW Atlas nor is the ease of use of the technology compared to the Atlas or our Jeep. There are some other annoying things about it, but we still like it a lot. Just glad it is leased and we did not buy it. If we could do it again, we would probably just buy another Atlas SEL Premium or maybe the MDX. More usable (the Atlas), drives almost as good and while you give up a little on interior materials to save $20k would certainly be worth it.  "

I bought the top of the line model, almost every option (although SHOCKINGLY) I did not realize Volvo skimped on giving me a hitch. Yes, the car has a hitch that ""pop out"" with the press of a button. I was assured it had it, had to have it, but upon COVID delivery, found out after the documents were signed it did not have it, and this is a $71,000 car. $71k! and no hitch from Volvo - the alleged, ""all weather"" car.

That said, here are my observations. The entertainment center SUCKS during real world driving. You really need to set things before you leave or pull over - very dangerous. The menus are still confusing a month in and finding things remains a mystery.

Safety? I bought the version that allegedly brakes for you, but I have tested it both on purpose and by accident and it seems to fail to go off every time. It constantly warns you that you are too close with the heads up display, but DOES NOT BRAKE. So this may be a recall item because it is on the build sheet.

The fuel mileage is AWFUL. I am averaging 14.9 miles per gallon. Yes, a 4 cylinder that averages 14.9. My Jeep with a lift kit and huge 37"" wheels gets 15.5 mpg. Where on earth is the 20 mpg I was supposed to get? I have taken no less than 50 trips and my fuel mileage remains very, very low. This seems to be a huge problem because 14mpg is atrocious for this car if that is the case in the city.

Seats. Wow, blew me away when I sat in it the first time but I have to say I constantly feel like I am being pushed forward. I feel they are not deep enough and even angle my seats slightly up so I do not feel like I will slide forward. With the massaging on, I think it is even worse. The automatic thigh support is nice, but going through the menus to adjust it, on the fly, again, very dangerous.

PHONE: EEKs, this may be the worst part. I take calls all the time in the car and have to crank the volume to 50 (halfway) to even hear people. And this, with the higher end stereo. Why does the volume suffer on calls so badly?

Comfort: Overall not bad, but am I thrilled about the above 45 days in? No. Again, my version is likely far better than 85% of the people who will read this as the car has almost every option Volvo order, save the aforementioned lacking of a hitch. OMG - terrible it does not have a hitch at $70,000!!!

That said, it drives well, lags a bit on take off with the 4 cylinder but gets up there as good as most SUV's. 

NOISES: I will say, upon exit, the car makes all kinds of weird creeks and noises. I know it is brand new, but it is a little unnerving. Little pings, bangs and creaking of the suspension or something. The car does lower when you get out, but it is not that noise.

Final note:

KEY FOBS:
Very nice looking, among the nicest LOOKING fobs regarding of buying a Bugatti or a Volvo. That said, the buttons are EXTREMELY hard to see and the beeping when you lock the car is so low, you cannot even hear it from inside your house. What car does not sound loud when you lock it? Well, the Volvo XC90 for one. 

So yes, there are many things that have disappointed me after buying it. Again, test driving it - we loved it. It looked great, sounded great, had no real issue and that is why we landed on it as the car to buy. But I will say the lack of power for the third row seats (at $70,000 or even higher), the infotainment, the seats pushing forward positioning, the noises, and the lack of a hitch and other things at this price really makes me wonder if I picked the right car. 

They say it takes time to get use to - well, I am 45 days in, and have 3-stared the car. There is your answer.

Some design features arent the greatest  - could use a few more buttons instead of a tablet, microscopic cup holders in a family vehicle? Visibility is horrendous when merging right due to the headrest in the second row. The Park assist is a fun gadget but not practical to use in real life. Pilot assist is buggy and is hair raisingly scary if used on roads with traffic lights or on roads where the lines are even slightly ambiguous. Best to keep it for highways. The tablet looks Tesla like but is not the most practical to control air etc when you are driving.Hands free Tailgate is quite poorly designed and takes a while to get used to. The child booster seat is pretty well designed though.Wish rear sunshades were an option. Why doesnt a 62k_ car have power tilt and telescopic steering and more controls on the seats.
Updated after 6 months - car drives well and no technical problems but I’ve put in just 2k miles. Volvo needs to add practical features like bigger cup holders, power tilt and telescoping steering, more storage, sun glasses holder etc. love the drive but interior design leaves a lot to be desired.

Our three row vehicle with bucked seats feels very spacious. Performance (acceleration and handling) has been good and gas mileage not that bad. Handling in snow and dirt roads was solid. The technology features are fantastic. We have had a few minor glitches - rear heating also causing the front fan to blow and blind spot warning not seeming to activate. Our choice of the XC90 was the right one.

Computer console is easy to navigate for a non-technical person like myself.

For the money, it’s hard to do a lot better. Sure, BMW was more fun to drive, but the X5 had little 3rd row was tiny, x7 was ridiculously large and priced as such. Audi was nice, but expensive when optioned, Lexus 3rd row was small and MB was very expensive. 

Volvo struck that sweet spot of feeling luxurious enough, priced well enough and a functional 3rd row backseat. It’s even marginally fun to drive (as much such a car this size can be). The leather is very nice and seats are supportive, most of the tablet functions are easy enough to get to with a good amount of customization. Wonderfully roomy, but doesn’t feel huge even in our constantly double-parked NYC streets. We got one off the lot that has the integrated center booster and I didn’t realize how nice it is. Our little one loves it. Also note - few cars have a real anchored middle seat. This one does - so even without using the booster you can fit 3 kids/car seats across. This can be a huge plus if you have 3 children. The booster just makes our life easy. The safety of Volvo is just the icing on top of it all and one of the biggest factors for us. The moonroof is big and adds airiness to the cabin, the in-door shades in the second row are great, and the sound system is excellent even though it’s not the $3,200 B&W option. Engine may be a T5, but I honestly never feel the need for more power, except of a little turbo lag in the first half a second, which it makes up for quickly afterwards.

Some of the things I would like better (cons) is the road noise is a little high for a car in this price range, the gas mileage could be a little better and I wish Apple CarPlay would display on the driver dash and Heads-up display. Seems like such an easy thing to do that would really add to the experience. All in all though, we could not find a better balance of price, luxury, safety and overall value. We actually look forward to driving this car every time even with it being a 3 row suv. It puts a smile on our face which says a lot to me as a former GTI driver. Very happy customer so far. "

It is sleek and aesthetically pleasing sure, but does that matter in a bad storm? Top heavy and loose handling  in my opinion. Driven on city roads, six lanes during a storm. Go drive it for yourself to make sure you are comfortable. "

It has so much technology.  I am still learning. The folks at White Plains Volvo helped me get the basics. They were great. It has ALL the safety features you could imagine and more. Lane Keep Assist, Blind Spot Monitor, Pilot Assist, 360 View Camera if you want( I don’t have it), HUD(Heads Up Display , which I don’t have), Remote Start and climate control directly from your Volvo phone app, Apple Car Play, Android Auto, Volvo apps such as weather, Glympse(I think), Google Search, Spotify, Pandora, Navigation, WiFi with AT&T, Sirius XM Radio, Digital Driver Information Display, Parking Sensors, and more. I leased the Momentun, which is NOT the most expensive. In addition, they include Complimentary Factory Scheduled Maintenance. This covers the first three services (10,000 miles, 20,000 miles and 30,000 miles) at no charge. Finally, my only concern is reliability. I only paid approximately $51,000 after the rebates and discounts. I love my Volvo. :) "

We live in the city and have been amazed to find we are getting around 35-40mpg.  For longer trips on the freeway the adaptive cruise control is fantastic, you set your ideal speed and the amount of following distance you want to keep to the car in front of you and the car will do all the accelerating and decelerating for you, when traffic slows so does the car without any need to break.  Also, the 6 passenger interior is perfect it is spacious and you can easily access the third row, plus since there’s a center aisle the people in the last row aren’t so cramped since they can extend their legs into the aisle.  The interior is what you would expect from Volvo, luxurious and incredibly comfortable.  "

Quiet, safe and very reliable. Nothing ever goes wrong with these Volvos. Only service was to replace windshield after flying rock hit on I-95. Considered every mid size luxury SUV on market. It was important that vehicle not be crass. Logos on grille that light up, exhausts making fast and pop sounds scream juvenile. And restrained styling inside and out are very important - the Germans and Japanese hard to stomach. Range Rover has horrible reliability issues. Volvo for Life. "

Nice looking ride, but unresponsive and underpowered I thought.  I understand going to a 4 cylinder to save gas, but, not worth the trade off imo.  This SUV needs a V6.  Maybe next time Volvo.  "

Got the 6 person version and it works great. Wish Apple car play was wireless, they had adjustable electric steering wheel and some storage under the back section (like my XC60 did). This is truly nit picking though as the luxurious feel, good performance and user friendliness are outstanding! "
